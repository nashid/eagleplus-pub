sklearn.utils.register_parallel_backend = register_parallel_backend(name, factory, make_default=False)
    Register a new Parallel backend factory.
    
    The new backend can then be selected by passing its name as the backend
    argument to the Parallel class. Moreover, the default backend can be
    overwritten globally by setting make_default=True.
    
    The factory can be any callable that takes no argument and return an
    instance of ``ParallelBackendBase``.
    
    Warning: this function is experimental and subject to change in a future
    version of joblib.
