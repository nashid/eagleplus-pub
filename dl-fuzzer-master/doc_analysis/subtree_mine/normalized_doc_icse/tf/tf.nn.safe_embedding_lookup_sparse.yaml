constraints:
  combiner:
    default: mean
    descp: A string specifying how to combine embedding results for each entry. Currently
      "mean", "sqrtn" and "sum" are supported, with "mean" the default.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE specifying how to combine embedding results for each entry
    - Currently QSTR are supported with QSTR the default
  default_id:
    default: None
    descp: The id to use for an entry with no features.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - The id to use for an entry with no features
  embedding_weights:
    descp: A list of `P` float `Tensor`s or values representing partitioned embedding
      `Tensor`s.  Alternatively, a `PartitionedVariable`created by partitioning along
      dimension 0.  The total unpartitioned shape should be `[e_0, e_1, ..., e_m]`,
      where `e_0` represents the vocab size and `e_1, ..., e_m` are the embedding
      dimensions.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE of QSTR D_TYPE D_STRUCTUREs or values representing partitioned
      embedding D_STRUCTUREs
    - Alternatively a QSTR created by partitioning along dimension CONSTANT_NUM
    - The total unpartitioned shape should be BSTR where QSTR e CONSTANT_NUM e_m are
      the embedding dimensions
  max_norm:
    default: None
    descp: If not `None`, all embeddings are l2-normalized to max_norm before combining.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - If not QSTR all embeddings are l2 normalized to max_norm before combining
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for this operation (optional).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for this operation BSTR
  sparse_ids:
    descp: '`SparseTensor` of shape `[d_0, d_1, ..., d_n]` containing the ids. `d_0`
      is typically batch size.'
    normalized_descp:
    - D_STRUCTURE of shape BSTR containing the ids
    - d CONSTANT_NUM is typically batch size
  sparse_weights:
    default: None
    descp: '`SparseTensor` of same shape as `sparse_ids`, containing float weights
      corresponding to `sparse_ids`, or `None` if all weights are be assumed to be
      1.0.'
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - D_STRUCTURE of same shape as PARAM containing D_TYPE weights corresponding to
      PARAM or QSTR if all weights are be assumed to be CONSTANT_FLOAT
exceptions:
- ValueError: if `embedding_weights` is empty.
inputs:
  optional:
  - sparse_weights
  - combiner
  - default_id
  - max_norm
  - name
  required:
  - embedding_weights
  - sparse_ids
