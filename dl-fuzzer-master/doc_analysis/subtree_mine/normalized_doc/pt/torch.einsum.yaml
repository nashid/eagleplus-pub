  equation:
    descp: The equation is given in terms of lower case letters (indices) to be associated
      with each dimension of the operands and result. The left hand side lists the
      operands dimensions, separated by commas. There should be one index letter per
      tensor dimension. The right hand side follows after -> and gives the indices
      for the output. If the -> and right hand side are omitted, it implicitly defined
      as the alphabetically sorted list of all indices appearing exactly once in the
      left hand side. The indices not apprearing in the output are summed over after
      multiplying the operands entries. If an index appears several times for the
      same operand, a diagonal is taken. Ellipses  u2026 represent a fixed number
      of dimensions. If the right hand side is inferred, the ellipsis dimensions are
      at the beginning of the output.
