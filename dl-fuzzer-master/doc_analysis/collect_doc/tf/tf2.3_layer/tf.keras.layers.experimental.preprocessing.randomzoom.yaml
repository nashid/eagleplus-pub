constraints:
  '**kwargs':
    descp: ''
  fill_mode:
    default: reflect
    descp: 'Points outside the boundaries of the input are filled according to the
      given mode (one of {''constant'', ''reflect'', ''wrap''}). reflect: (d c b a
      | a b c d | d c b a) The input is extended by reflecting about the edge of the
      last pixel. constant: (k k k k | a b c d | k k k k) The input is extended by
      filling all values beyond the edge with the same constant value k = 0. wrap:
      (a b c d | a b c d | a b c d)'
  height_factor:
    descp: a float represented as fraction of value, or a tuple of size 2 representing
      lower and upper bound for zooming vertically. When represented as a single float,
      this value is used for both the upper and lower bound. A positive value means
      zooming out, while a negative value means zooming in. For instance, height_factor=(0.2,
      0.3) result in an output zoomed out by a random amount in the range [+20%, +30%].
      height_factor=(-0.3, -0.2) result in an output zoomed in by a random amount
      in the range [+20%, +30%].
  interpolation:
    default: bilinear
    descp: 'Interpolation mode. Supported values: "nearest", "bilinear".'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A string, the name of the layer.
  seed:
    default: None
    descp: Integer. Used to create a random seed.
  width_factor:
    default: None
    descp: a float represented as fraction of value, or a tuple of size 2 representing
      lower and upper bound for zooming horizontally. When represented as a single
      float, this value is used for both the upper and lower bound. For instance,
      width_factor=(0.2, 0.3) result in an output zooming out between 20% to 30%.
      width_factor=(-0.3, -0.2) result in an output zooming in between 20% to 30%.
      Defaults to None, i.e., zooming vertical and horizontal directions by preserving
      the aspect ratio.
inputs:
  optional:
  - width_factor
  - fill_mode
