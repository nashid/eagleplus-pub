constraints:
  data_format:
    default: NHWC
    descp: 'An optional string from: "NHWC", "NCHW". Defaults to "NHWC". The data
      format for y_backprop, x, x_backprop. Either "NHWC" (default) or "NCHW".'
  epsilon:
    default: '0.0001'
    descp: An optional float. Defaults to 0.0001. A small float number added to the
      variance of x.
  is_training:
    default: 'True'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to True. A bool value to indicate the operation
      is for training (default) or inference.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  reserve_space_1:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as y_backprop. When is_training is True,
      a 1D Tensor for the computed batch mean to be reused in gradient computation.
      When is_training is False, a 1D Tensor for the population mean to be reused
      in both 1st and 2nd order gradient computation.
  reserve_space_2:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as y_backprop. When is_training is True,
      a 1D Tensor for the computed batch variance (inverted variance in the cuDNN
      case) to be reused in gradient computation. When is_training is False, a 1D
      Tensor for the population variance to be reused in both 1st and 2nd order gradient
      computation.
  scale:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as y_backprop. A 1D Tensor for scaling
      factor, to scale the normalized x.
  x:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as y_backprop. A 4D Tensor for input
      data.
  y_backprop:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32. A 4D Tensor for
      the gradient with respect to y.'
