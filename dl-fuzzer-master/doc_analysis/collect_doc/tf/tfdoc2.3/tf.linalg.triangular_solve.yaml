- tf.compat.v1.matrix_triangular_solve
constraints:
  adjoint:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. Boolean indicating whether to solve
      with matrix or its (block-wise) adjoint.
  lower:
    default: 'True'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to True. Boolean indicating whether the innermost
      matrices in matrix are lower or upper triangular.
  matrix:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float64, float32, half,
      complex64, complex128. Shape is [..., M, M].'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  rhs:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as matrix. Shape is [..., M, N].
inputs:
  optional:
  - lower
  - adjoint
