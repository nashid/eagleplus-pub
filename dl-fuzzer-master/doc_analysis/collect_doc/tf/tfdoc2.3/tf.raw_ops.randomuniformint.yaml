constraints:
  maxval:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as minval. 0-D. Exclusive upper bound
      on the generated integers.
  minval:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. 0-D. Inclusive
      lower bound on the generated integers.'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  seed:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. If either seed or seed2 are set to be non-zero,
      the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, it is seeded
      by a random seed.
  seed2:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. A second seed to avoid seed collision.
  shape:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. The shape
      of the output tensor.'
inputs:
  optional:
  - seed
  - seed2
  - name
  required:
  - shape
  - minval
  - maxval
