  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for this operation (optional). Defaults to "assert_less".
  summarize:
    default: None
    descp: Print this many entries of each tensor.
  x:
    descp: Numeric Tensor.
  y:
    descp: Numeric Tensor, same dtype as and broadcastable to x.
exceptions:
- InvalidArgumentError: if the check can be performed immediately and x < y is False.
    The check can be performed immediately during eager execution or if x and y are
    statically known.

outputs:
- Op that raises InvalidArgumentError if x < y is False. This can be used with tf.control_dependencies
  inside of tf.functions to block followup computation until the check has executed.
