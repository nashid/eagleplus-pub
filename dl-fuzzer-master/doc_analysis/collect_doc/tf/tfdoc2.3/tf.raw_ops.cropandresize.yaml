constraints:
  box_ind:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. A 1-D tensor of shape [num_boxes] with int32 values
      in [0, batch). The value of box_ind[i] specifies the image that the i-th box
      refers to.
  boxes:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. A 2-D tensor of shape [num_boxes, 4]. The i-th
      row of the tensor specifies the coordinates of a box in the box_ind[i] image
      and is specified in normalized coordinates [y1, x1, y2, x2]. A normalized coordinate
      value of y is mapped to the image coordinate at y * (image_height - 1), so as
      the [0, 1] interval of normalized image height is mapped to [0, image_height
      - 1] in image height coordinates. We do allow y1 > y2, in which case the sampled
      crop is an up-down flipped version of the original image. The width dimension
      is treated similarly. Normalized coordinates outside the [0, 1] range are allowed,
      in which case we use extrapolation_value to extrapolate the input image values.
  crop_size:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. A 1-D tensor of 2 elements, size = [crop_height,
      crop_width]. All cropped image patches are resized to this size. The aspect
      ratio of the image content is not preserved. Both crop_height and crop_width
      need to be positive.
  extrapolation_value:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional float. Defaults to 0. Value used for extrapolation, when applicable.
  image:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: uint8, uint16, int8, int16,
      int32, int64, half, float32, float64. A 4-D tensor of shape [batch, image_height,
      image_width, depth]. Both image_height and image_width need to be positive.'
  method:
    default: bilinear
    descp: 'An optional string from: "bilinear", "nearest". Defaults to "bilinear".
      A string specifying the sampling method for resizing. It can be either "bilinear"
      or "nearest" and default to "bilinear". Currently two sampling methods are supported:
      Bilinear and Nearest Neighbor.'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
