- tf.compat.v1.signal.overlap_and_add
constraints:
  frame_step:
    descp: An integer or scalar `Tensor` denoting overlap offsets. Must be less than
      or equal to `frame_length`.
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE or scalar D_STRUCTURE denoting overlap offsets
    - Must be less than or equal to QSTR
  name:
    default: None
    descp: An optional name for the operation.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - An optional name for the operation
  signal:
    descp: A [..., frames, frame_length] `Tensor`. All dimensions may be unknown,
      and rank must be at least 2.
    normalized_descp:
    - A BSTR D_STRUCTURE
    - All dimensions may be unknown, and rank must be at least CONSTANT_NUM
exceptions:
- ValueError: If `signal`'s rank is less than 2, or `frame_step` is not a scalar integer.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
