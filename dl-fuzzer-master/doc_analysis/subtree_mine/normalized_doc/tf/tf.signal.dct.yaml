constraints:
  axis:
    default: '-1'
    descp: For future expansion. The axis to compute the DCT along. Must be `-1`.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_NUM
    normalized_descp:
    - For future expansion
    - The axis to compute the DCT along
    - Must be CONSTANT_NUM
  input:
    descp: A `[..., samples]` `float32`/`float64` `Tensor` containing the signals
      to take the DCT of.
    normalized_descp:
    - A BSTR D_TYPE D_STRUCTURE containing the signals to take the DCT of
  n:
    default: None
    descp: The length of the transform. If length is less than sequence length, only
      the first n elements of the sequence are considered for the DCT. If n is greater
      than the sequence length, zeros are padded and then the DCT is computed as usual.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - The length of the transform
    - If length is less than D_STRUCTURE length, only the first n elements of the
      D_STRUCTURE are considered for the DCT
    - If n is greater than the D_STRUCTURE length, zeros are padded and then the DCT
      is computed as usual
  name:
    default: None
    descp: An optional name for the operation.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - An optional name for the operation
  norm:
    default: None
    descp: The normalization to apply. `None` for no normalization or `'ortho'`for
      orthonormal normalization.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - The normalization to apply
    - QSTR for no normalization or QSTR for orthonormal normalization
  type:
    default: '2'
    descp: The DCT type to perform. Must be 1, 2 or 3.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_NUM
    normalized_descp:
    - The DCT type to perform
    - Must be CONSTANT_NUM
exceptions:
- ValueError: If `type` is not `1`, `2` or `3`, `axis` is not `-1`, `n` is not `None`
    or greater than 0, or `norm` is not `None` or `'ortho'`.
- ValueError: If `type` is `1` and `norm` is `ortho`.
