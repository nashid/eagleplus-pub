- tf.compat.v1.nn.conv1d_transpose
constraints:
  data_format:
    default: NWC
    descp: A string. `'NWC'` and `'NCW'` are supported.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE
    - QSTR are supported
  dilations:
    default: None
    descp: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1` or `3` which defaults to 1.
      The dilation factor for each dimension of input. If set to k > 1, there will
      be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that dimension. Dilations
      in the batch and depth dimensions must be 1.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE or D_STRUCTURE of D_TYPE that has length CONSTANT_NUM which defaults
      to CONSTANT_NUM
    - The dilation factor for each dimension of PARAM
    - If set to k REXPR there will be k CONSTANT_NUM skipped cells between each filter
      element on that dimension
    - Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions must be CONSTANT_NUM
  filters:
    descp: A 3-D `Tensor` with the same type as `value` and shape`[filter_width, output_channels,
      in_channels]`.  `filter`'s`in_channels` dimension must match that of `value`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM D D_STRUCTURE with the same type as QSTR and shape BSTR
    - QSTR s QSTR dimension must match that of QSTR
  input:
    descp: A 3-D `Tensor` of type `float` and shape`[batch, in_width, in_channels]`
      for `NWC` data format or`[batch, in_channels, in_width]` for `NCW` data format.
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM D D_STRUCTURE of type D_TYPE and shape BSTR for QSTR data format
      or BSTR for QSTR data format
  name:
    default: None
    descp: Optional name for the returned tensor.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Optional name for the returned D_STRUCTURE
  output_shape:
    descp: A 1-D `Tensor`, containing three elements, representing the output shape
      of the deconvolution op.
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM D D_STRUCTURE containing three elements representing the output
      shape of the deconvolution op
  padding:
    default: SAME
    descp: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm. See the
      "returns" section of `tf.nn.convolution` for details.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE either QSTR
    - The padding algorithm
    - See the QSTR section of tf nn convolution for details
  strides:
    descp: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1` or `3`.  The number of entries
      by which the filter is moved right at each step.
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE or D_STRUCTURE of D_TYPE that has length CONSTANT_NUM
    - The number of entries by which the filter is moved right at each step
exceptions:
- ValueError: If input/output depth does not match `filter`'s shape, if`output_shape`
    is not at 3-element vector, if `padding` is other than`'VALID'` or `'SAME'`, or
    if `data_format` is invalid.
inputs:
  optional:
  - padding
  - data_format
  - dilations
  - name
  required:
