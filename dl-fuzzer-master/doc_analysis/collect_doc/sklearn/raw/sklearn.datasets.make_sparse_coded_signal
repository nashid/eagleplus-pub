sklearn.datasets.make_sparse_coded_signal = make_sparse_coded_signal(n_samples, n_components, n_features, n_nonzero_coefs, random_state=None)
    Generate a signal as a sparse combination of dictionary elements.
    
    Returns a matrix Y = DX, such as D is (n_features, n_components),
    X is (n_components, n_samples) and each column of X has exactly
    n_nonzero_coefs non-zero elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_samples : int
        number of samples to generate
    
    n_components :  int,
        number of components in the dictionary
    
    n_features : int
        number of features of the dataset to generate
    
    n_nonzero_coefs : int
        number of active (non-zero) coefficients in each sample
    
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None (default)
        Determines random number generation for dataset creation. Pass an int
        for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.
    
    Returns
    -------
    data : array of shape [n_features, n_samples]
        The encoded signal (Y).
    
    dictionary : array of shape [n_features, n_components]
        The dictionary with normalized components (D).
    
    code : array of shape [n_components, n_samples]
        The sparse code such that each column of this matrix has exactly
        n_nonzero_coefs non-zero items (X).
