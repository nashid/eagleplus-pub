,"A optional list of default values for the CSV fields. One item per selected column of the input record. Each item in the list is either a valid CSV dtype (float32, float64, int32, int64, or string), or a`Tensor` with one of the aforementioned types. The tensor can either be a scalar default value (if the column is optional), or an empty tensor (if the column is required). If a dtype is provided instead of a tensor, the column is also treated as required. If this list is not provided, tries to infer types based on reading the first num_rows_for_inference rows of files specified, and assumes all columns are optional, defaulting to `0`for numeric values and `""""` for string values. If both this and`select_columns` are specified, these must have the same lengths, and`column_defaults` is assumed to be sorted in order of increasing column index.",None,nonprim_dtype,structure(list),,1
