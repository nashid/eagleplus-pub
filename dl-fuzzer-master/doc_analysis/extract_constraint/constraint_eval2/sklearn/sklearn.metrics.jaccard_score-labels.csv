,"list, optional The set of labels to include when ``average != 'binary'``, and their order if ``average is None``. Labels present in the data can be excluded, for example to calculate a multiclass average ignoring a majority negative class, while labels not present in the data will result in 0 components in a macro average. For multilabel targets, labels are column indices. By default, all labels in ``y_true`` and ``y_pred`` are used in sorted order.",None,shape,ndim(1),,1
