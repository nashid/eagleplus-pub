constraints:
  data_format:
    default: NDHWC
    descp: 'An optional string from: "NDHWC", "NCDHW". Defaults to "NDHWC". The data
      format of the input and output data. With the default format "NDHWC", the data
      is stored in the order of: [batch, in_depth, in_height, in_width, in_channels].
      Alternatively, the format could be "NCDHW", the data storage order is: [batch,
      in_channels, in_depth, in_height, in_width].'
  input:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, bfloat16, float32,
      float64. Shape [batch, depth, rows, cols, channels] tensor to pool over.'
  ksize:
    descp: A list of ints that has length >= 5. 1-D tensor of length 5. The size of
      the window for each dimension of the input tensor. Must have ksize[0] = ksize[4]
      = 1.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  padding:
    descp: 'A string from: "SAME", "VALID". The type of padding algorithm to use.'
  strides:
    descp: A list of ints that has length >= 5. 1-D tensor of length 5. The stride
      of the sliding window for each dimension of input. Must have strides[0] = strides[4]
      = 1.
