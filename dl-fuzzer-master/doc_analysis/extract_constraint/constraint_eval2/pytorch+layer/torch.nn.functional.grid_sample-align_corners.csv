bool,"Geometrically, we consider the pixels of the input  as squares rather than points. If set to `True`, the extrema (`-1` and `1`) are considered as referring to the center points of the input's corner pixels. If set to `False`, they are instead considered as referring to the corner points of the input's corner pixels, making the sampling more resolution agnostic. This option parallels the `align_corners` option in `interpolate()`, and so whichever option is used here should also be used there to resize the input image before grid sampling.
