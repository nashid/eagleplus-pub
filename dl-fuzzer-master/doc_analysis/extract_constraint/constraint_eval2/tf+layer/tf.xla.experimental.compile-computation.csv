,"A Python function that builds a computation to apply to the input. If the function takes n inputs, 'inputs' should be a list of n tensors.`computation` may return a list of operations and tensors.  Tensors must come before operations in the returned list.  The return value of`compile` is a list of tensors corresponding to the tensors from the output of `computation`.All `Operation`s returned from `computation` will be executed when evaluating any of the returned output tensors.",,,,0,0
