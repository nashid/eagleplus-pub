aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.keras.backend.ctc_decode
constraints:
  beam_width:
    default: '100'
    descp: 'if greedy is false: a beam search decoder will be used with a beam of
      this width.'
  greedy:
    default: 'True'
    descp: perform much faster best-path search if true. This does not use a dictionary.
  input_length:
    descp: tensor (samples, ) containing the sequence length for each batch item in
      y_pred.
  top_paths:
    default: '1'
    descp: if greedy is false, how many of the most probable paths will be returned.
  y_pred:
    descp: tensor (samples, time_steps, num_categories) containing the prediction,
      or output of the softmax.
inputs:
  optional:
  - greedy
  - beam_width
  - top_paths
  required:
  - y_pred
  - input_length

outputs:
- Tuple: 'List: if greedy is true, returns a list of one element that contains the
    decoded sequence. If false, returns the top_paths most probable decoded sequences.
    Important: blank labels are returned as -1. Tensor (top_paths, ) that contains
    the log probability of each decoded sequence.'
