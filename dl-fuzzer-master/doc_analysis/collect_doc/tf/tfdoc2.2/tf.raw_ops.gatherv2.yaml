constraints:
  axis:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. The axis in
      params to gather indices from. Defaults to the first dimension. Supports negative
      indexes.'
  batch_dims:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0.

      Must be in range [0, params.shape[axis]).'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  params:
    descp: A Tensor. The tensor from which to gather values. Must be at least rank
      axis + 1.
