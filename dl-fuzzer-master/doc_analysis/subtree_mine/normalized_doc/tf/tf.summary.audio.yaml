constraints:
  data:
    descp: A `Tensor` representing audio data with shape `[k, t, c]`, where `k` is
      the number of audio clips, `t` is the number of frames, and `c` is the number
      of channels. Elements should be floating-point values in `[-1.0, 1.0]`. Any
      of the dimensions may be statically unknown (i.e., `None`).
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE representing audio data with shape BSTR, where QSTR is the number
      of audio clips, QSTR is the number of frames, and QSTR is the number of channels
    - Elements should be D_TYPE values in BSTR
    - Any of the dimensions may be statically unknown i e , QSTR
  description:
    default: None
    descp: Optional long-form description for this summary, as a constant `str`. Markdown
      is supported. Defaults to empty.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Optional long form description for this summary, as a constant D_TYPE
    - Markdown is supported
    - Defaults to empty
  encoding:
    default: None
    descp: Optional constant `str` for the desired encoding. Only "wav" is currently
      supported, but this is not guaranteed to remain the default, so if you want
      "wav" in particular, set this explicitly.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Optional constant D_TYPE for the desired encoding
    - Only QSTR is currently supported, but this is not guaranteed to remain the default,
      so if you want QSTR in particular, set this explicitly
  max_outputs:
    default: '3'
    descp: Optional `int` or rank-0 integer `Tensor`. At most this many audio clips
      will be emitted at each step. When more than`max_outputs` many clips are provided,
      the first `max_outputs`many clips will be used and the rest silently discarded.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_NUM
    normalized_descp:
    - Optional D_TYPE or rank CONSTANT_NUM D_TYPE D_STRUCTURE
    - At most this many audio clips will be emitted at each PARAM
    - When more than QSTR many clips are provided, the first QSTR many clips will
      be used and the rest silently discarded
  name:
    descp: A name for this summary. The summary tag used for TensorBoard will be this
      name prefixed by any active name scopes.
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for this summary
    - The summary tag used for TensorBoard will be this name prefixed by any active
      name scopes
  sample_rate:
    descp: An `int` or rank-0 `int32` `Tensor` that represents the sample rate, in
      Hz. Must be positive.
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE or rank CONSTANT_NUM D_TYPE D_STRUCTURE that represents the sample
      rate, in Hz
    - Must be positive
  step:
    default: None
    descp: Explicit `int64`-castable monotonic step value for this summary. If omitted,
      this defaults to `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`, which must not be None.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Explicit D_TYPE castable monotonic step value for this summary
    - If omitted, this defaults to tf summary experimental get_step , which must not
      be None
exceptions:
- ValueError: if a default writer exists, but no step was provided and`tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`
    is None.
inputs:
  optional:
  - step
  - max_outputs
  - encoding
  - description

  - name
  - data
