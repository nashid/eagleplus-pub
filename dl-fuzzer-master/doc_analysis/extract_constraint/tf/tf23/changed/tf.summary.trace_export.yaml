constraints:
  name:
    descp: A name for the summary to be written.
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  profiler_outdir:
    default: None
    descp: Output directory for profiler. This is only used when the profiler was
      enabled when the trace was started. In that case, if there is a logdir-based
      default SummaryWriter, this defaults to the same directory, but otherwise the
      argument must be passed.
  step:
    default: None
    descp: Explicit int64-castable monotonic step value for this summary. If omitted,
      this defaults to tf.summary.experimental.get_step(), which must not be None.
exceptions:
- ValueError: if a default writer exists, but no step was provided and tf.summary.experimental.get_step()
    is None.
inputs:
  optional:
  - step
  - profiler_outdir
  required:
