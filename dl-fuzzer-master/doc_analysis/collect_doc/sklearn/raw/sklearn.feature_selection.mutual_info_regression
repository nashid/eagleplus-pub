sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_regression = mutual_info_regression(X, y, discrete_features='auto', n_neighbors=3, copy=True, random_state=None)
    Estimate mutual information for a continuous target variable.
    
    Mutual information (MI) [1]_ between two random variables is a non-negative
    value, which measures the dependency between the variables. It is equal
    to zero if and only if two random variables are independent, and higher
    values mean higher dependency.
    
    The function relies on nonparametric methods based on entropy estimation
    from k-nearest neighbors distances as described in [2]_ and [3]_. Both
    methods are based on the idea originally proposed in [4]_.
    
    It can be used for univariate features selection, read more in the
    :ref:`User Guide <univariate_feature_selection>`.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array_like or sparse matrix, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Feature matrix.
    
    y : array_like, shape (n_samples,)
        Target vector.
    
    discrete_features : {'auto', bool, array_like}, default 'auto'
        If bool, then determines whether to consider all features discrete
        or continuous. If array, then it should be either a boolean mask
        with shape (n_features,) or array with indices of discrete features.
        If 'auto', it is assigned to False for dense `X` and to True for
        sparse `X`.
    
    n_neighbors : int, default 3
        Number of neighbors to use for MI estimation for continuous variables,
        see [2]_ and [3]_. Higher values reduce variance of the estimation, but
        could introduce a bias.
    
    copy : bool, default True
        Whether to make a copy of the given data. If set to False, the initial
        data will be overwritten.
    
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default None
        The seed of the pseudo random number generator for adding small noise
        to continuous variables in order to remove repeated values.
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.
    
    Returns
    -------
    mi : ndarray, shape (n_features,)
        Estimated mutual information between each feature and the target.
    
    Notes
    -----
    1. The term "discrete features" is used instead of naming them
       "categorical", because it describes the essence more accurately.
       For example, pixel intensities of an image are discrete features
       (but hardly categorical) and you will get better results if mark them
       as such. Also note, that treating a continuous variable as discrete and
       vice versa will usually give incorrect results, so be attentive about that.
    2. True mutual information can't be negative. If its estimate turns out
       to be negative, it is replaced by zero.
