constraints:
  capacity:
    default: '-1'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to -1. The upper bound on the number of elements
      in this queue. Negative numbers mean no limit.
  component_types:
    descp: A list of tf.DTypes that has length >= 1. The type of each component in
      a value.
  container:
    default: ''
    descp: An optional string. Defaults to "". If non-empty, this queue is placed
      in the given container. Otherwise, a default container is used.
  min_after_dequeue:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. Dequeue will block unless there would be
      this many elements after the dequeue or the queue is closed. This ensures a
      minimum level of mixing of elements.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  seed:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. If either seed or seed2 is set to be non-zero,
      the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, a random
      seed is used.
  seed2:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. A second seed to avoid seed collision.
  shapes:
    default: '[]'
    descp: An optional list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints). Defaults
      to []. The shape of each component in a value. The length of this attr must
      be either 0 or the same as the length of component_types. If the length of this
      attr is 0, the shapes of queue elements are not constrained, and only one element
      may be dequeued at a time.
  shared_name:
    default: ''
    descp: An optional string. Defaults to "". If non-empty, this queue will be shared
      under the given name across multiple sessions.
