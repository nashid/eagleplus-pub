constraints:
  deleter:
    descp: A Tensor of type variant. A variant deleter.
  iterators:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects with type resource. A list of iterator handles
      (unused). This is added so that automatic control dependencies get added during
      function tracing that ensure this op runs after all the dependent iterators
      are deleted.
  multi_device_iterator:
    descp: A Tensor of type resource. A handle to the multi device iterator to delete.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - multi_device_iterator
  - iterators
  - deleter
