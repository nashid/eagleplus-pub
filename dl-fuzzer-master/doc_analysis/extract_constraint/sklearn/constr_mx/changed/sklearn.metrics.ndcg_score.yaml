constraints:
  ignore_ties:
    default: 'False'
    descp: bool, optional (default=False) Assume that there are no ties in y_score
      (which is likely to be the case if y_score is continuous) for efficiency gains.
    dtype:
    - boolean
    ndim:
    - '0'
  k:
    default: None
    descp: int, optional (default=None) Only consider the highest k scores in the
      ranking. If None, use all outputs.
    dtype:
    - int
  sample_weight:
    default: None
    descp: ndarray, shape (n_samples,), optional (default=None) Sample weights. If
      None, all samples are given the same weight.
    dtype:
    - numeric
  y_score:
    descp: ndarray, shape (n_samples, n_labels) Target scores, can either be probability
      estimates, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions (as returned
      by "decision_function" on some classifiers).
  y_true:
    descp: ndarray, shape (n_samples, n_labels) True targets of multilabel classification,
      or true scores of entities to be ranked.
inputs:
  optional:
  - k
  - sample_weight
  - ignore_ties
  required:
  - y_true
  - y_score
