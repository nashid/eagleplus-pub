sklearn.utils.sparsefuncs.incr_mean_variance_axis = incr_mean_variance_axis(X, axis, last_mean, last_var, last_n)
    Compute incremental mean and variance along an axix on a CSR or
    CSC matrix.
    
    last_mean, last_var are the statistics computed at the last step by this
    function. Both must be initialized to 0-arrays of the proper size, i.e.
    the number of features in X. last_n is the number of samples encountered
    until now.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    X : CSR or CSC sparse matrix, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Input data.
    
    axis : int (either 0 or 1)
        Axis along which the axis should be computed.
    
    last_mean : float array with shape (n_features,)
        Array of feature-wise means to update with the new data X.
    
    last_var : float array with shape (n_features,)
        Array of feature-wise var to update with the new data X.
    
    last_n : int with shape (n_features,)
        Number of samples seen so far, excluded X.
    
    Returns
    -------
    
    means : float array with shape (n_features,)
        Updated feature-wise means.
    
    variances : float array with shape (n_features,)
        Updated feature-wise variances.
    
    n : int with shape (n_features,)
        Updated number of seen samples.
    
    Notes
    -----
    NaNs are ignored in the algorithm.
