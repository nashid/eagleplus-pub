constraints:
  filter:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as input. 4-D with shape [filter_height,
      filter_width, in_channels, out_channels].
  input:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, float32, float64.
      4-D with shape [batch, in_height, in_width, in_channels].'
  mode:
    descp: 'A string from: "REFLECT", "SYMMETRIC".'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  padding:
    descp: 'A string from: "SAME", "VALID". The type of padding algorithm to use.'
  paddings:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. A two-column matrix specifying the padding sizes.
      The number of rows must be the same as the rank of input.
  strides:
    descp: A list of ints. 1-D of length 4. The stride of the sliding window for each
      dimension of input. Must be in the same order as the dimension specified with
      format.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
