constraints:
  back_prop:
    default: 'True'
    descp: (optional) True enables support for back propagation.
  elems:
    descp: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, each of which will be
      unpacked along their first dimension.  The nested sequence of the resulting
      slices will be the first argument to `fn`.
  fn:
    descp: The callable to be performed.  It accepts two arguments.  The first will
      have the same structure as `initializer` if one is provided, otherwise it will
      have the same structure as `elems`.  The second will have the same (possibly
      nested) structure as `elems`.  Its output must have the same structure as `initializer`
      if one is provided, otherwise it must have the same structure as `elems`.
  infer_shape:
    default: 'True'
    descp: (optional) False disables tests for consistent output shapes.
  initializer:
    default: None
    descp: (optional) A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, initial value
      for the accumulator, and the expected output type of `fn`.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: (optional) Name prefix for the returned tensors.
  parallel_iterations:
    default: '10'
    descp: (optional) The number of iterations allowed to run in parallel.
  reverse:
    default: 'False'
    descp: (optional) True scans the tensor last to first (instead of first to last).
  swap_memory:
    default: 'False'
    descp: (optional) True enables GPU-CPU memory swapping.
exceptions:
- TypeError: if `fn` is not callable or the structure of the output of`fn` and `initializer`
    do not match.
- ValueError: if the lengths of the output of `fn` and `initializer`do not match.
inputs:
  optional:
  - initializer
  - parallel_iterations
  - back_prop
  - swap_memory
  - infer_shape
  - reverse
  - name
  required:
  - fn
  - elems

outputs: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors.  Each tensor packs the
  results of applying `fn` to tensors unpacked from `elems` along the first dimension,
  and the previous accumulator value(s), from first to last (or last to first, if
  `reverse=True`).
