constraints:
  key_func:
    descp: A function mapping a nested structure of tensors (having shapes and types
      defined by `self.output_shapes` and`self.output_types`) to a scalar `tf.int64`
      tensor.
    normalized_descp:
    - A function mapping a nested structure of D_STRUCTURE having shapes and types
      defined by self output_shapes QSTR self output_types to a scalar D_TYPE D_STRUCTURE
  reduce_func:
    descp: A function mapping a key and a dataset of up to `window_size`consecutive
      elements matching that key to another dataset.
    normalized_descp:
    - A function mapping a key and a dataset of up to PARAMconsecutive elements matching
      that key to another dataset
  window_size:
    default: None
    descp: A `tf.int64` scalar `tf.Tensor`, representing the number of consecutive
      elements matching the same key to combine in a single batch, which will be passed
      to `reduce_func`. Mutually exclusive with`window_size_func`.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE scalar D_STRUCTURE, representing the number of consecutive elements
      matching the same key to combine in a single batch, which will be passed to
      PARAM
    - Mutually exclusive with PARAM
  window_size_func:
    default: None
    descp: A function mapping a key to a `tf.int64` scalar`tf.Tensor`, representing
      the number of consecutive elements matching the same key to combine in a single
      batch, which will be passed to`reduce_func`. Mutually exclusive with `window_size`.

exceptions:
- ValueError: if neither or both of {`window_size`, `window_size_func`} are passed.
