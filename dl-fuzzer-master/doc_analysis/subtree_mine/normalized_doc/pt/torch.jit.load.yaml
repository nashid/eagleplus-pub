constraints:
  _extra_files:
    default: ExtraFilesMap{}
    descp: The extra filenames given in the map would be loaded and their content
      would be stored in the provided map.
    doc_dtype: dictionary of filename to content
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - The extra filenames given in the map would be loaded and their content would
      be stored in the provided map
    normalized_docdtype: D_STRUCTURE of filename to content
  f:
    descp: a file-like object (has to implement read, readline, tell, and seek), or
      a string containing a file name
    normalized_descp:
    - a file like object BSTR, or a D_TYPE containing a file name
  map_location:
    default: None
    descp: A simplified version of `map_location` in `torch.save` used to dynamically
      remap storages to an alternative set of devices.
    doc_dtype: string or torch.device
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A simplified version of QSTR in torch save used to dynamically remap storages
      to an alternative set of devices
    normalized_docdtype: D_TYPE or torch device
inputs:
  optional:
  - map_location
