aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.nn.conv_transpose
constraints:
  data_format:
    default: None
    descp: A string or None. Specifies whether the channel dimension of the input
      and output is the last dimension (default, or if data_format does not start
      with "NC"), or the second dimension (if data_format starts with "NC"). For N=1,
      the valid values are "NWC" (default) and "NCW". For N=2, the valid values are
      "NHWC" (default) and "NCHW". For N=3, the valid values are "NDHWC" (default)
      and "NCDHW".
  dilations:
    default: None
    descp: An int or list of ints that has length 1, N or N+2, defaults to 1. The
      dilation factor for each dimension ofinput. If a single value is given it is
      replicated in the spatial dimensions. By default the N and C dimensions are
      set to 1. If set to k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between each filter
      element on that dimension. The dimension order is determined by the value of
      data_format, see above for details.
  filters:
    descp: An N+2 dimensional Tensor with the same type as input and shape spatial_filter_shape
      + [in_channels, out_channels].
  input:
    descp: 'An N+2 dimensional Tensor of shape [batch_size] + input_spatial_shape
      + [in_channels] if data_format does not start with "NC" (default), or [batch_size,
      in_channels] + input_spatial_shape if data_format starts with "NC". It must
      be one of the following types: half, bfloat16, float32, float64.'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional). If not specified "conv_transpose"
      is used.
  output_shape:
    descp: A 1-D Tensor representing the output shape of the deconvolution op.
  padding:
    default: SAME
    descp: A string, either 'VALID' or 'SAME'. The padding algorithm. See the "returns"
      section of tf.nn.convolution for details.
  strides:
    descp: An int or list of ints that has length 1, N or N+2. The stride of the sliding
      window for each dimension of input. If a single value is given it is replicated
      in the spatial dimensions. By default the N and C dimensions are set to 0. The
      dimension order is determined by the value of data_format, see below for details.
inputs:
  optional:
  - padding
  - data_format
  - dilations
  - name
  required:
  - input
  - filters
  - output_shape
