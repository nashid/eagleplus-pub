aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.concat
constraints:
  axis:
    descp: 0-D `int32` `Tensor`.  Dimension along which to concatenate. Must be in
      the range `[-rank(values), rank(values))`. As in Python, indexing for axis is
      0-based. Positive axis in the rage of `[0, rank(values))` refers to `axis`-th
      dimension. And negative axis refers to `axis + rank(values)`-th dimension.
    normalized_descp:
    - CONSTANT_NUM-D D_TYPE D_STRUCTURE
    - Dimension along which to concatenate
    - Must be in the range BSTR
    - As in Python, indexing for axis is CONSTANT_NUM based
    - Positive axis in the rage of BSTR refers to QSTR th dimension
    - And negative axis refers to axis rank BSTR th dimension
  name:
    default: concat
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for the operation BSTR
  values:
    descp: A list of `Tensor` objects or a single `Tensor`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE of D_STRUCTURE objects or a single D_STRUCTURE
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - values
