outputs:
- A Keras model instance. If the original model was compiled, and saved with the optimizer,
  then the returned model will be compiled. Otherwise, the model will be left uncompiled.
  In the case that an uncompiled model is returned, a warning is displayed if the
  compile argument is set to True.
