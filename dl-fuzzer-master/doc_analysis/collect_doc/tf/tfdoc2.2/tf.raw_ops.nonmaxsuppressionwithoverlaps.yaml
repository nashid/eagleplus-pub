constraints:
  max_output_size:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. A scalar integer tensor representing the maximum
      number of boxes to be selected by non max suppression.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  overlap_threshold:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. A 0-D float tensor representing the threshold
      for deciding whether boxes overlap too.
  overlaps:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. A 2-D float tensor of shape [num_boxes, num_boxes]
      representing the n-by-n box overlap values.
  score_threshold:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. A 0-D float tensor representing the threshold
      for deciding when to remove boxes based on score.
  scores:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. A 1-D float tensor of shape [num_boxes] representing
      a single score corresponding to each box (each row of boxes).
