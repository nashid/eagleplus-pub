sklearn.datasets.fetch_species_distributions = fetch_species_distributions(data_home=None, download_if_missing=True)
    Loader for species distribution dataset from Phillips et. al. (2006)
    
    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <datasets>`.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data_home : optional, default: None
        Specify another download and cache folder for the datasets. By default
        all scikit-learn data is stored in '~/scikit_learn_data' subfolders.
    
    download_if_missing : optional, True by default
        If False, raise a IOError if the data is not locally available
        instead of trying to download the data from the source site.
    
    Returns
    -------
    The data is returned as a Bunch object with the following attributes:
    
    coverages : array, shape = [14, 1592, 1212]
        These represent the 14 features measured at each point of the map grid.
        The latitude/longitude values for the grid are discussed below.
        Missing data is represented by the value -9999.
    
    train : record array, shape = (1624,)
        The training points for the data.  Each point has three fields:
    
        - train['species'] is the species name
        - train['dd long'] is the longitude, in degrees
        - train['dd lat'] is the latitude, in degrees
    
    test : record array, shape = (620,)
        The test points for the data.  Same format as the training data.
    
    Nx, Ny : integers
        The number of longitudes (x) and latitudes (y) in the grid
    
    x_left_lower_corner, y_left_lower_corner : floats
        The (x,y) position of the lower-left corner, in degrees
    
    grid_size : float
        The spacing between points of the grid, in degrees

    Notes
    -----
    
    This dataset represents the geographic distribution of species.
    The dataset is provided by Phillips et. al. (2006).
    
    The two species are:
    
    - `"Bradypus variegatus"
      <http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/3038/0>`_ ,
      the Brown-throated Sloth.
    
    - `"Microryzomys minutus"
      <http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/13408/0>`_ ,
      also known as the Forest Small Rice Rat, a rodent that lives in Peru,
      Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.
