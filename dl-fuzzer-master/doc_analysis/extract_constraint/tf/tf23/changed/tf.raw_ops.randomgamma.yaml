constraints:
  alpha:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, float32, float64.
      A tensor in which each scalar is a "shape" parameter describing the associated
      gamma distribution.'
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:

  seed:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. If either seed or seed2 are set to be non-zero,
      the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, it is seeded
      by a random seed.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:

  seed2:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. A second seed to avoid seed collision.

    ndim:
    - '0'
  shape:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. 1-D integer
      tensor. Shape of independent samples to draw from each distribution described
      by the shape parameters given in alpha.'
