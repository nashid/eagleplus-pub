constraints:
  X:
    descp: array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features) Data from which to compute the
      covariance estimate
  assume_centered:
    default: 'False'
    descp: boolean, default=False If True, data will not be centered before computation.
      Useful to work with data whose mean is significantly equal to zero but is not
      exactly zero. If False, data will be centered before computation.
    dtype:
    - boolean
    ndim:
    - '0'
  block_size:
    default: '1000'
    descp: int, default=1000 Size of the blocks into which the covariance matrix will
      be split. This is purely a memory optimization and does not affect results.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
inputs:
  optional:
  - assume_centered
  - block_size
  required:
