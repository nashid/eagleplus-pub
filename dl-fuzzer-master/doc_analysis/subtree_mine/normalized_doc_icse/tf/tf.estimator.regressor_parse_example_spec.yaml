constraints:
  feature_columns:
    descp: An iterable containing all feature columns. All items should be instances
      of classes derived from `_FeatureColumn`.
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_STRUCTURE containing all feature columns
    - All items should be instances of classes derived from QSTR
  label_default:
    default: None
    descp: used as label if label_key does not exist in given tf.Example. By default
      default_value is none, which means`tf.parse_example` will error out if there
      is any missing label.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - used as label if PARAM does not exist in given tf Example
    - By default default_value is none which means tf parse_example will error out
      if there is any missing label
  label_dimension:
    default: '1'
    descp: Number of regression targets per example. This is the size of the last
      dimension of the labels and logits `Tensor` objects (typically, these have shape
      `[batch_size, label_dimension]`).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_NUM
    normalized_descp:
    - Number of regression targets per example
    - This is the size of the last dimension of the labels and logits D_STRUCTURE
      objects typically these have shape BSTR
  label_dtype:
    default: tf.dtypes.float32
    descp: A `tf.dtype` identifies the type of labels. By default it is`tf.float32`.
    normalized_default: D_TYPE D_TYPE
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE identifies the type of labels
    - By default it isD_TYPE
  label_key:
    descp: A string identifying the label. It means tf.Example stores labels with
      this key.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE identifying the label
    - It means tf Example stores labels with this key
  weight_column:
    default: None
    descp: A string or a `NumericColumn` created by`tf.feature_column.numeric_column`
      defining feature column representing weights. It is used to down weight or boost
      examples during training. It will be multiplied by the loss of the example.
      If it is a string, it is used as a key to fetch weight tensor from the `features`.
      If it is a`NumericColumn`, raw tensor is fetched by key `weight_column.key`,
      then weight_column.normalizer_fn is applied on it to get weight tensor.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE or a QSTR created by tf feature_column numeric_column defining feature
      column representing weights
    - It is used to down weight or boost examples during training
    - It will be multiplied by the loss of the example
    - If it is a D_TYPE it is used as a key to fetch weight D_STRUCTURE from the QSTR
    - If it is a QSTR raw D_STRUCTURE is fetched by key weight_column key then weight_column
      normalizer_fn is applied on it to get weight D_STRUCTURE
exceptions:
- ValueError: If label is used in `feature_columns`.
- ValueError: If weight_column is used in `feature_columns`.
- ValueError: If any of the given `feature_columns` is not a `_FeatureColumn`instance.
- ValueError: If `weight_column` is not a `NumericColumn` instance.
- ValueError: if label_key is None.
