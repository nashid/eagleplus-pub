aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.repeat
constraints:
  axis:
    default: None
    descp: An int. The axis along which to repeat values. By default (axis=None),
      use the flattened input array, and return a flat output array.
  input:
    descp: An N-dimensional Tensor.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation.
  repeats:
    descp: An 1-D int Tensor. The number of repetitions for each element. repeats
      is broadcasted to fit the shape of the given axis. len(repeats) must equal input.shape[axis]
      if axis is not None.
inputs:
  optional:
  - axis
  - name
  required:
  - input
  - repeats
link: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/repeat
outputs:
- A Tensor which has the same shape as input, except along the given axis. If axis
  is None then the output array is flattened to match the flattened input array.
