constraints:
  ids:
    descp: A Tensor with type int32 or int64 containing the ids to be looked up in
      params.
  max_norm:
    default: None
    descp: If not None, each embedding is clipped if its l2-norm is larger than this
      value.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  params:
    descp: A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor, or a list of
      P tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension, representing sharded
      embedding tensors. Alternatively, a PartitionedVariable, created by partitioning
      along dimension 0. Each element must be appropriately sized for the 'div' partition_strategy.
exceptions:
- ValueError: If params is empty.
inputs:
  optional:
  - max_norm
  - name
  required:
  - params
  - ids
