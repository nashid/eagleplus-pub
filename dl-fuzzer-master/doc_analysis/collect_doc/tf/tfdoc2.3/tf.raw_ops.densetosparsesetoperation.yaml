constraints:
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  set1:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int8, int16, int32, int64,
      uint8, uint16, string. Tensor with rank n. 1st n-1 dimensions must be the same
      as set2. Dimension n contains values in a set, duplicates are allowed but ignored.'
  set2_indices:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. 2D Tensor, indices of a SparseTensor. Must be in
      row-major order.
  set2_shape:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. 1D Tensor, shape of a SparseTensor. set2_shape[0...n-1]
      must be the same as the 1st n-1 dimensions of set1, result_shape[n] is the max
      set size across n-1 dimensions.
  set2_values:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as set1. 1D Tensor, values of a SparseTensor.
      Must be in row-major order.

    descp: A string.
  validate_indices:
    default: 'True'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to True.
