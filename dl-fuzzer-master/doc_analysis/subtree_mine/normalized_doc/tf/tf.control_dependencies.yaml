constraints:
  control_inputs:
    descp: A list of `Operation` or `Tensor` objects which must be executed or computed
      before running the operations defined in the context. Can also be `None` to
      clear the control dependencies. If eager execution is enabled, any callable
      object in the `control_inputs` list will be called.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE of QSTR or D_STRUCTURE objects which must be executed or computed
      before running the operations defined in the context
    - Can also be QSTR to clear the control dependencies
    - If eager execution is enabled, any callable object in the QSTR D_STRUCTURE will
      be called
inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - control_inputs

  constructed within the context.
