constraints:
  output_size:
    descp: the target output size of the image of the form H x W. Can be a tuple (H,
      W) or a single H for a square image H x H. H and W can be either a `int`, or
      `None` which means the size will be the same as that of the input.
    normalized_descp:
    - the target output size of the image of the form H x W Can be a D_STRUCTURE BSTR
      or a single H for a square image H x H H and W can be either a D_TYPE or QSTR
      which means the size will be the same as that of the input
  return_indices:
    default: 'False'
    descp: 'if `True`, will return the indices along with the outputs. Useful to pass
      to nn.MaxUnpool2d. Default: `False`'
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_descp:
    - if CONSTANT_BOOL will return the indices along with the outputs
    - Useful to pass to nn MaxUnpool2d
    - Default CONSTANT_BOOL
inputs:
  optional:
  - return_indices
  required:
  - output_size
