constraints:
  accum:
    descp: A Tensor of type resource. Should be from a Variable().
  grad:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64, int32,
      uint8, int16, int8, complex64, int64, qint8, quint8, qint32, bfloat16, uint16,
      complex128, half, uint32, uint64. The gradient.'
  l1:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as grad. L1 regularization. Must be a
      scalar.
  l2:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as grad. L2 shrinkage regularization.
      Must be a scalar.
  l2_shrinkage:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as grad.
  linear:
    descp: A Tensor of type resource. Should be from a Variable().
  lr:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as grad. Scaling factor. Must be a scalar.
  lr_power:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as grad. Scaling factor. Must be a scalar.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  use_locking:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. If True, updating of the var and accum
      tensors will be protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but
      may exhibit less contention.
  var:
    descp: A Tensor of type resource. Should be from a Variable().
