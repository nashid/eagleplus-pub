constraints:
  back_prop:
    default: 'True'
    descp: '(optional) Deprecated: prefer using tf.stop_gradient instead. False disables
      support for back propagation.'
  dtype:
    default: None
    descp: 'Deprecated: Equivalent to fn_output_signature.'
  elems:
    descp: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, each of which will be
      unstacked along their first dimension. fn will be applied to the nested sequence
      of the resulting slices. elems may include ragged and sparse tensors.
  fn:
    descp: The callable to be performed. It accepts one argument, which will have
      the same (possibly nested) structure as elems. Its output must have the same
      structure as fn_output_signature if one is provided; otherwise it must have
      the same structure as elems.
  fn_output_signature:
    default: None
    descp: 'The output signature of fn. Must be specified if fn''s input and output
      signatures are different (i.e., if their structures, dtypes, or tensor types
      do not match). fn_output_signature can be specified using any of the following:
      A tf.DType or tf.TensorSpec (to describe a tf.Tensor) A tf.RaggedTensorSpec
      (to describe a tf.RaggedTensor) A tf.SparseTensorSpec (to describe a tf.sparse.SparseTensor)
      A (possibly nested) tuple, list, or dict containing the above types.'
  infer_shape:
    default: 'True'
    descp: (optional) False disables tests for consistent output shapes.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: (optional) Name prefix for the returned tensors.
  parallel_iterations:
    default: None
    descp: (optional) The number of iterations allowed to run in parallel. When graph
      building, the default value is 10. While executing eagerly, the default value
      is set to 1.
  swap_memory:
    default: 'False'
    descp: (optional) True enables GPU-CPU memory swapping.
exceptions:
- TypeError: if fn is not callable or the structure of the output of fn and fn_output_signature
    do not match.
- ValueError: if the lengths of the output of fn and fn_output_signature do not match.

outputs:
- A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors. Each tensor stacks the results
  of applying fn to tensors unstacked from elems along the first dimension, from first
  to last. The result may include ragged and sparse tensors.
