bool,"recompute the scale_factor for use in the interpolation calculation.  When scale_factor is passed as a parameter, it is used to compute the output_size.  If recompute_scale_factor is ``True` or not specified, a new scale_factor will be computed based on the output and input sizes for use in the interpolation computation (i.e. the computation will be identical to if the computed output_size were passed-in explicitly).  Otherwise, the passed-in scale_factor will be used in the interpolation computation.  Note that when scale_factor is floating-point, the recomputed scale_factor may differ from the one passed in due to rounding and precision issues.",None,prim_dtype,dtype(torch.bool),,1
