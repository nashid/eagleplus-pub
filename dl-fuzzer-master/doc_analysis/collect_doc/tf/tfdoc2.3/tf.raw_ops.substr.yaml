constraints:
  input:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. Tensor of strings
  len:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as pos. Scalar defining the number of
      characters to include in each substring
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  pos:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. Scalar defining
      the position of first character in each substring'
  unit:
    default: BYTE
    descp: 'An optional string from: "BYTE", "UTF8_CHAR". Defaults to "BYTE". The
      unit that is used to create the substring. One of: "BYTE" (for defining position
      and length by bytes) or "UTF8_CHAR" (for the UTF-8 encoded Unicode code points).
      The default is "BYTE". Results are undefined if unit=UTF8_CHAR and the input
      strings do not contain structurally valid UTF-8.'
exceptions:
- 'ValueError: If the first argument cannot be converted to a Tensor of dtype string.
  InvalidArgumentError: If indices are out of range. ValueError: If pos and len are
  not the same shape.'
inputs:
  optional:
  - unit
  - name
  required:
