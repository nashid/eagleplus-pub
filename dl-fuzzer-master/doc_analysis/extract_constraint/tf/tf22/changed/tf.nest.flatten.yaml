aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.nest.flatten
constraints:
  expand_composites:
    default: 'False'
    descp: If true, then composite tensors such as tf.SparseTensor and tf.RaggedTensor
      are expanded into their component tensors.
    dtype:
    - tf.bool
    ndim:
    - '0'
  structure:
    descp: an arbitrarily nested structure. Note, numpy arrays are considered atoms
      and are not flattened.
exceptions:
- TypeError: The nest is or contains a dict with non-sortable keys.
inputs:
  optional:
  - expand_composites
