constraints:
  data:
    descp: A mutable Tensor. The ref tensor to be forwarded to the appropriate output.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  pred:
    descp: A Tensor of type bool. A scalar that specifies which output port will receive
      data.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:

outputs:
- A tuple of Tensor objects (output_false, output_true).
- output_false: A mutable Tensor. Has the same type as data.
- output_true: A mutable Tensor. Has the same type as data.
