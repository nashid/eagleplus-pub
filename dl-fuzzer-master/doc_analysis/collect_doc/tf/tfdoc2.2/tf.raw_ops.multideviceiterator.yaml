constraints:
  container:
    descp: A string. If non-empty, this resource is placed in the given container.
      Otherwise, a default container is used.
  devices:
    descp: A list of strings that has length >= 1. A list of devices the iterator
      works across.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_shapes:
    descp: A list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints) that has length
      >= 1. The list of shapes being produced.
  output_types:
    descp: A list of tf.DTypes that has length >= 1. The type list for the return
      values.
  shared_name:
    descp: A string. If non-empty, this resource will be shared under the given name
      across multiple sessions.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
