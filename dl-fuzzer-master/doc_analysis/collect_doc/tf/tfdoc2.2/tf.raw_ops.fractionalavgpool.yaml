constraints:
  deterministic:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. When set to True, a fixed pooling
      region will be used when iterating over a FractionalAvgPool node in the computation
      graph. Mainly used in unit test to make FractionalAvgPool deterministic.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  overlapping:
    default: 'False'
    descp: 'An optional bool. Defaults to False. When set to True, it means when pooling,
      the values at the boundary of adjacent pooling cells are used by both cells.
      For example: index 0 1 2 3 4 value 20 5 16 3 7 If the pooling sequence is [0,
      2, 4], then 16, at index 2 will be used twice. The result would be [41/3, 26/3]
      for fractional avg pooling.'
  pooling_ratio:
    descp: A list of floats that has length >= 4. Pooling ratio for each dimension
      of value, currently only supports row and col dimension and should be >= 1.0.
      For example, a valid pooling ratio looks like [1.0, 1.44, 1.73, 1.0]. The first
      and last elements must be 1.0 because we don't allow pooling on batch and channels
      dimensions. 1.44 and 1.73 are pooling ratio on height and width dimensions respectively.
  pseudo_random:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. When set to True, generates the pooling
      sequence in a pseudorandom fashion, otherwise, in a random fashion. Check paper
      Benjamin Graham, Fractional Max-Pooling for difference between pseudorandom
      and random.
  seed:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. If either seed or seed2 are set to be non-zero,
      the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, it is seeded
      by a random seed.
  seed2:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. An second seed to avoid seed collision.
  value:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64, int32,
      int64. 4-D with shape [batch, height, width, channels].'
