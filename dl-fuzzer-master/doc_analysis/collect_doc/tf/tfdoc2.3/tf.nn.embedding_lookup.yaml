constraints:
  ids:
    descp: A Tensor with type int32 or int64 containing the ids to be looked up in
      params.
  max_norm:
    default: None
    descp: If not None, each embedding is clipped if its l2-norm is larger than this
      value.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  params:
    descp: A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor, or a list of
      tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension, representing sharded
      embedding tensors following "div" partition strategy.
exceptions:
- ValueError: If params is empty.
inputs:
  optional:
  - max_norm
  - name
  required:
  - params
  - ids

outputs:
- 'A Tensor with the same type as the tensors in params. For instance, if params is
  a 5x2 matrix: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]] or a list of matrices: params[0]:
  [[1, 2], [3, 4]] params[1]: [[5, 6], [7, 8]] params[2]: [[9, 10]] and ids is: [0,
  3, 4] The output will be a 3x2 matrix: [[1, 2], [7, 8], [9, 10]]'
