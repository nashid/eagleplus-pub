,"A 2-D tensor of shape `[num_boxes, 4]`. The `i`-th row of the tensor specifies the coordinates of a box in the `box_ind[i]` image and is specified in normalized coordinates `[y1, x1, y2, x2]`. A normalized coordinate value of `y` is mapped to the image coordinate at `y * (image_height - 1)`, so as the `[0, 1]` interval of normalized image height is mapped to `[0, image_height - 1]` in image height coordinates. We do allow `y1` > `y2`, in which case the sampled crop is an up-down flipped version of the original image. The width dimension is treated similarly. Normalized coordinates outside the `[0, 1]` range are allowed, in which case we use `extrapolation_value` to extrapolate the input image values.",,nonprim_dtype,tensor_t(tf.tensor),,1
