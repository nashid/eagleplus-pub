constraints:
  batch_size:
    default: '128'
    descp: Number of timeseries samples in each batch (except maybe the last one).
  data:
    descp: Numpy array or eager tensor containing consecutive data points (timesteps).
      Axis 0 is expected to be the time dimension.
  end_index:
    default: None
    descp: Optional int; data points later (exclusive) than end_index will not be
      used in the output sequences. This is useful to reserve part of the data for
      test or validation.
  sampling_rate:
    default: '1'
    descp: Period between successive individual timesteps within sequences. For rate
      r, timesteps data[i], data[i + r], ... data[i + sequence_length] are used for
      create a sample sequence.
  seed:
    default: None
    descp: Optional int; random seed for shuffling.
  sequence_length:
    descp: Length of the output sequences (in number of timesteps).
  sequence_stride:
    default: '1'
    descp: Period between successive output sequences. For stride s, output samples
      would start at index data[i], data[i + s], data[i + 2 * s], etc.
  shuffle:
    default: 'False'
    descp: Whether to shuffle output samples, or instead draw them in chronological
      order.
  start_index:
    default: None
    descp: Optional int; data points earlier (exclusive) than start_index will not
      be used in the output sequences. This is useful to reserve part of the data
      for test or validation.
  targets:
    descp: Targets corresponding to timesteps in data. It should have same length
      as data. targets[i] should be the target corresponding to the window that starts
      at index i (see example 2 below). Pass None if you don't have target data (in
      this case the dataset will only yield the input data).
inputs:
  optional:
  - sequence_stride
  - sampling_rate
  - batch_size
  - shuffle
  - seed
  - start_index
  - end_index
  required:
  - data
  - targets
  - sequence_length

outputs:
- A tf.data.Dataset instance. If targets was passed, the dataset yields tuple (batch_of_sequences,
  batch_of_targets). If not, the dataset yields only batch_of_sequences.
