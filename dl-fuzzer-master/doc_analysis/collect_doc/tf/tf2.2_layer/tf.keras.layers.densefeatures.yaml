constraints:
  '**kwargs':
    descp: Keyword arguments to construct a layer.
  feature_columns:
    descp: An iterable containing the FeatureColumns to use as inputs to your model.
      All items should be instances of classes derived from DenseColumn such as numeric_column,
      embedding_column, bucketized_column, indicator_column. If you have categorical
      features, you can wrap them with an embedding_column or indicator_column.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: Name to give to the DenseFeatures.
  trainable:
    default: 'True'
    descp: Boolean, whether the layer's variables will be updated via gradient descent
      during training.
exceptions:
- ValueError: if an item in feature_columns is not a DenseColumn.
inputs:
  optional:
  - trainable
  - name
  required:
  - feature_columns
  - '**kwargs'
