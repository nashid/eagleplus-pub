constraints:
  begin:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. begin[i] specifies
      the offset into the ''i''th dimension of ''input'' to slice from.'
  input:
    descp: A Tensor.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  size:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as begin. size[i] specifies the number
      of elements of the 'i'th dimension of 'input' to slice. If size[i] is -1, all
      remaining elements in dimension i are included in the slice (i.e. this is equivalent
      to setting size[i] = input.dim_size(i) - begin[i]).
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - input
  - begin
  - size
