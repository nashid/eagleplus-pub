constraints:
  beta:
    default: '1.0'
    descp: float Ratio of weight attributed to ``homogeneity`` vs ``completeness``.
      If ``beta`` is greater than 1, ``completeness`` is weighted more strongly in
      the calculation. If ``beta`` is less than 1, ``homogeneity`` is weighted more
      strongly.
