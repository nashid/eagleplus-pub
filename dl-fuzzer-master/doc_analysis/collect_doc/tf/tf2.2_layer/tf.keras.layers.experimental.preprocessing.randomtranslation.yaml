constraints:
  '**kwargs':
    descp: ''
  fill_mode:
    default: constant
    descp: 'Points outside the boundaries of the input are filled according to the
      given mode (one of {''constant'', ''reflect'', ''wrap''}). reflect: (d c b a
      | a b c d | d c b a) The input is extended by reflecting about the edge of the
      last pixel. constant: (k k k k | a b c d | k k k k) The input is extended by
      filling all values beyond the edge with the same constant value k = 0. wrap:
      (a b c d | a b c d | a b c d) The input is extended by wrapping around to the
      opposite edge.'
  height_factor:
    descp: a positive float represented as fraction of value, or a tuple of size 2
      representing lower and upper bound for shifting vertically. When represented
      as a single float, this value is used for both the upper and lower bound. For
      instance, height_factor=(0.2, 0.3) results in an output height varying in the
      range [original - 20%, original + 30%]. height_factor=0.2 results in an output
      height varying in the range [original - 20%, original + 20%].
  interpolation:
    default: bilinear
    descp: 'Interpolation mode. Supported values: "nearest", "bilinear".'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A string, the name of the layer.
  seed:
    default: None
    descp: Integer. Used to create a random seed.
  width_factor:
    descp: a positive float represented as fraction of value, or a tuple of size 2
      representing lower and upper bound for shifting horizontally. When represented
      as a single float, this value is used for both the upper and lower bound.
inputs:
  optional:
  - fill_mode
  - interpolation
