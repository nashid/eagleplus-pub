,"Sets the format of the checkpoint saved by the estimator when training. May be `saver` or `checkpoint`, depending on whether to save checkpoints from `tf.compat.v1.train.Saver` or `tf.train.Checkpoint`. The default is `checkpoint`. Estimators use name-based `tf.train.Saver`checkpoints, while Keras models use object-based checkpoints from`tf.train.Checkpoint`. Currently, saving object-based checkpoints from`model_to_estimator` is only supported by Functional and Sequential models.",checkpoint,prim_dtype,dtype(tf.bool),,1
