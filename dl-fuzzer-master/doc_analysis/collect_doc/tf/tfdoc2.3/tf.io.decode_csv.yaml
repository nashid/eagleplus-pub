constraints:
  field_delim:
    default: ','
    descp: An optional string. Defaults to ",". char delimiter to separate fields
      in a record.
  na_value:
    default: ''
    descp: Additional string to recognize as NA/NaN.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  record_defaults:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects with specific types. Acceptable types are float32,
      float64, int32, int64, string. One tensor per column of the input record, with
      either a scalar default value for that column or an empty vector if the column
      is required.
  records:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. Each string is a record/row in the csv and all
      records should have the same format.
  select_cols:
    default: None
    descp: Optional sorted list of column indices to select. If specified, only this
      subset of columns will be parsed and returned.
  use_quote_delim:
    default: 'True'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to True. If false, treats double quotation marks
      as regular characters inside of the string fields (ignoring RFC 4180, Section
      2, Bullet 5).
exceptions:
- ValueError: If any of the arguments is malformed.
inputs:
  optional:
  - field_delim

outputs:
- A list of Tensor objects. Has the same type as record_defaults. Each tensor will
  have the same shape as records.
