constraints:
  axis:
    default: None
    descp: A 0-D int Tensor representing the axis in `tensor` to mask from. By default,
      axis is 0 which will mask from the first dimension. Otherwise K + axis <= N.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM-D D_TYPE D_STRUCTURE representing the axis in D_STRUCTURE to
      PARAM from
    - By default, axis is CONSTANT_NUM which will PARAM from the first dimension
    - Otherwise K axis REXPR
  mask:
    descp: K-D boolean tensor, K <= N and K must be known statically.
    normalized_descp:
    - K D D_TYPE D_STRUCTURE, K REXPR and K must be known statically
  name:
    default: boolean_mask
    descp: A name for this operation (optional).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for this operation BSTR
  tensor:
    descp: N-D tensor.
    normalized_descp:
    - N D D_STRUCTURE
exceptions:
- ValueError: If shapes do not conform.
inputs:
  optional:
  - axis
  - name
  required:
  - tensor
  - mask
