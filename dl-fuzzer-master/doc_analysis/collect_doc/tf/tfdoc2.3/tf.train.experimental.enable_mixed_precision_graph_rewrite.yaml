constraints:
  loss_scale:
    default: dynamic
    descp: Either an int/float, the string "dynamic", or an instance of a tf.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScale.
      The loss scale to use. It is recommended to keep this as its default value of
      "dynamic", which will adjust the scaling automatically to prevent Inf or NaN
      values.
  opt:
    descp: An instance of a tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer.
exceptions:
- ValueError, if the tf.keras.mixed_precision API is also used by calling tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy.
  Only one mixed precision API can be used.
inputs:
  optional:
  - loss_scale
  required:
  - opt

outputs:
- A version of opt that will use loss scaling to prevent underflow.
