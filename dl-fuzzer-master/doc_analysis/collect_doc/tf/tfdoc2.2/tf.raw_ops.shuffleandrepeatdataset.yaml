constraints:
  buffer_size:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. The number of output elements to buffer in an iterator
      over this dataset. Compare with the min_after_dequeue attr when creating a RandomShuffleQueue.
  count:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. A scalar representing the number of times the underlying
      dataset should be repeated. The default is -1, which results in infinite repetition.
  input_dataset:
    descp: A Tensor of type variant.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_shapes:
    descp: A list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints) that has length
      >= 1.
  output_types:
    descp: A list of tf.DTypes that has length >= 1.
  seed:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. A scalar seed for the random number generator.
      If either seed or seed2 is set to be non-zero, the random number generator is
      seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, a random seed is used.
  seed2:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. A second scalar seed to avoid seed collision.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - input_dataset
  - buffer_size
  - seed
  - seed2
  - count
  - output_types
  - output_shapes
