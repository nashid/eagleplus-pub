constraints:
  device_ordinal:
    default: '-1'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to -1. The TPU device to use. This should be
      -1 when the Op is running on a TPU device, and >= 0 when the Op is running on
      the CPU device.
  input:
    descp: A Tensor. A tensor that will be provided using the infeed mechanism.
  layout:
    default: '[]'
    descp: An optional list of ints. Defaults to []. A vector holding the requested
      layout in minor-to-major sequence. If a layout attribute is passed, but its
      values are all -1, the layout will be computed by the infeed operation.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  shape:
    default: '[]'
    descp: An optional tf.TensorShape or list of ints. Defaults to []. The shape of
      the tensor.
inputs:
  optional:
  - shape
  - layout
  - device_ordinal
  - name
  required:
