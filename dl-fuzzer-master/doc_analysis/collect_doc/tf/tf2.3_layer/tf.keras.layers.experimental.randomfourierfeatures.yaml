constraints:
  '**kwargs':
    descp: ''
  kernel_initializer:
    default: gaussian
    descp: Determines the distribution of the parameters of the random features map
      (and therefore the kernel approximated by the layer). It can be either a string
      identifier or a Keras Initializer instance. Currently only 'gaussian' and 'laplacian'
      are supported string identifiers (case insensitive). Note that the kernel matrix
      is not trainable.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: String, name to use for this layer.
  output_dim:
    descp: Positive integer, the dimension of the layer's output, i.e., the number
      of random features used to approximate the kernel.
  scale:
    default: None
    descp: 'For Gaussian and Laplacian kernels, this corresponds to a scaling factor
      of the corresponding kernel approximated by the layer (see concrete definitions
      above). When provided, it should be a positive float. If None, a default value
      is used: if the kernel initializer is set to "gaussian", scale defaults to sqrt(input_dim
      / 2), otherwise, it defaults to 1.0. Both the approximation error of the kernel
      and the classification quality are sensitive to this parameter. If trainable
      is set to True, this parameter is learned end-to-end during training and the
      provided value serves as the initial value. Note: When features from this layer
      are fed to a linear model, by making scale trainable, the resulting optimization
      problem is no longer convex (even if the loss function used by the linear model
      is convex).'
  trainable:
    default: 'False'
    descp: Whether the scaling parameter of the layer should be trainable. Defaults
      to False.

  optional:
  - kernel_initializer
