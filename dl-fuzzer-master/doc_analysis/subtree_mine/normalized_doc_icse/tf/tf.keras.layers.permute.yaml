constraints:
  '**kwargs':
    default: null
    descp: ''
    normalized_descp: []
  dims:
    descp: Tuple of integers. Permutation pattern, does not include the samples dimension.
      Indexing starts at 1. For instance, `(2, 1)` permutes the first and second dimensions
      of the input.
    normalized_descp:
    - D_STRUCTURE of D_TYPE
    - Permutation pattern does not include the samples dimension
    - Indexing starts at CONSTANT_NUM
    - For instance BSTR permutes the first and second dimensions of the input
inputs:
  optional:
  - '**kwargs'
  required:
  - dims
