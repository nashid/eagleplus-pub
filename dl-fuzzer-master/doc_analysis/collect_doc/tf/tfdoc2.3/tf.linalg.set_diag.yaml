  align:
    default: RIGHT_LEFT
    descp: 'Some diagonals are shorter than max_diag_len and need to be padded. align
      is a string specifying how superdiagonals and subdiagonals should be aligned,
      respectively. There are four possible alignments: "RIGHT_LEFT" (default), "LEFT_RIGHT",
      "LEFT_LEFT", and "RIGHT_RIGHT". "RIGHT_LEFT" aligns superdiagonals to the right
      (left-pads the row) and subdiagonals to the left (right-pads the row). It is
      the packing format LAPACK uses. cuSPARSE uses "LEFT_RIGHT", which is the opposite
      alignment.'
  diagonal:
    descp: A Tensor with rank k, when d_lower == d_upper, or k + 1, otherwise. k >=
      1.
  input:
    descp: A Tensor with rank k + 1, where k >= 1.
  k:
    default: '0'
    descp: Diagonal offset(s). Positive value means superdiagonal, 0 refers to the
      main diagonal, and negative value means subdiagonals. k can be a single integer
      (for a single diagonal) or a pair of integers specifying the low and high ends
      of a matrix band. k[0] must not be larger than k[1].
  name:
    default: set_diag
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
