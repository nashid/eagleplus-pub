constraints:
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  num_sampled:
    descp: An int that is >= 1. Number of candidates to randomly sample.
  num_true:
    descp: An int that is >= 1. Number of true labels per context.
  range_max:
    descp: An int that is >= 1. The sampler will sample integers from the interval
      [0, range_max).
  seed:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. If either seed or seed2 are set to be non-zero,
      the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, it is seeded
      by a random seed.
  seed2:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. An second seed to avoid seed collision.
  true_classes:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. A batch_size * num_true matrix, in which each row
      contains the IDs of the num_true target_classes in the corresponding original
      label.
  unique:
    descp: A bool. If unique is true, we sample with rejection, so that all sampled
      candidates in a batch are unique. This requires some approximation to estimate
      the post-rejection sampling probabilities.
inputs:
  optional:
  - seed
  - seed2
  - name
  required:
  - true_classes
  - num_true
  - num_sampled
  - unique
  - range_max
