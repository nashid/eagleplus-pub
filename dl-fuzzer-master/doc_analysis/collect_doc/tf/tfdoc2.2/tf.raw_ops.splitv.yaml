constraints:
  axis:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. 0-D. The dimension along which to split. Must be
      in the range [-rank(value), rank(value)).
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  num_split:
    descp: An int that is >= 1.
  size_splits:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. list containing
      the sizes of each output tensor along the split dimension. Must sum to the dimension
      of value along split_dim. Can contain one -1 indicating that dimension is to
      be inferred.'
