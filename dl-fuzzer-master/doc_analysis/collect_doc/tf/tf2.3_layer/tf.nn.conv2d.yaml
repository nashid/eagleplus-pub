constraints:
  data_format:
    default: NHWC
    descp: 'An optional string from: "NHWC", "NCHW". Defaults to "NHWC". Specify the
      data format of the input and output data. With the default format "NHWC", the
      data is stored in the order of: batch_shape + [height, width, channels]. Alternatively,
      the format could be "NCHW", the data storage order of: batch_shape + [channels,
      height, width].'
  dilations:
    default: None
    descp: An int or list of ints that has length 1, 2 or 4, defaults to 1. The dilation
      factor for each dimension ofinput. If a single value is given it is replicated
      in the H and W dimension. By default the N and C dimensions are set to 1. If
      set to k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on
      that dimension. The dimension order is determined by the value of data_format,
      see above for details. Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions if a 4-d
      tensor must be 1.
  filters:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as input. A 4-D tensor of shape [filter_height,
      filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]
  input:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, bfloat16, float32,
      float64. A Tensor of rank at least 4. The dimension order is interpreted according
      to the value of data_format; with the all-but-inner-3 dimensions acting as batch
      dimensions. See below for details.'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  padding:
    descp: Either the string "SAME" or "VALID" indicating the type of padding algorithm
      to use, or a list indicating the explicit paddings at the start and end of each
      dimension. When explicit padding is used and data_format is "NHWC", this should
      be in the form [[0, 0], [pad_top, pad_bottom], [pad_left, pad_right], [0, 0]].
      When explicit padding used and data_format is "NCHW", this should be in the
      form [[0, 0], [0, 0], [pad_top, pad_bottom], [pad_left, pad_right]].
  strides:
    descp: An int or list of ints that has length 1, 2 or 4. The stride of the sliding
      window for each dimension of input. If a single value is given it is replicated
      in the H and W dimension. By default the N and C dimensions are set to 1. The
      dimension order is determined by the value of data_format, see below for details.
inputs:
  optional:
  - data_format
  - dilations
  - name
  required:
  - input
  - filters
