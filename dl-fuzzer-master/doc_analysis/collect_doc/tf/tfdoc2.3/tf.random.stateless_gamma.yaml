aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.random.stateless_gamma
constraints:
  alpha:
    descp: Tensor. The concentration parameter of the gamma distribution. Must be
      broadcastable with beta, and broadcastable with the rightmost dimensions of
      shape.
  beta:
    default: None
    descp: Tensor. The inverse scale parameter of the gamma distribution. Must be
      broadcastable with alpha and broadcastable with the rightmost dimensions of
      shape.
  dtype:
    default: tf.dtypes.float32
    descp: Floating point dtype of alpha, beta, and the output.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  seed:
    descp: A shape [2] Tensor, the seed to the random number generator. Must have
      dtype int32 or int64. (When using XLA, only int32 is allowed.)
  shape:
    descp: A 1-D integer Tensor or Python array. The shape of the output tensor.
inputs:
  optional:
  - beta
  - dtype
  - name
  required:
  - shape
  - seed
  - alpha

outputs:
- samples: A Tensor of the specified shape filled with random gamma values. For each
    i, each `samples[..., i] is an independent draw from the gamma distribution with
    concentration alpha[i] and scale beta[i].
