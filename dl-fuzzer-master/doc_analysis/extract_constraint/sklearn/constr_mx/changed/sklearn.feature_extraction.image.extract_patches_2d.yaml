constraints:
  image:
    descp: 'array, shape = (image_height, image_width) or (image_height, image_width,
      n_channels) The original image data. For color images, the last dimension specifies
      the channel: a RGB image would have `n_channels=3`.'
  max_patches:
    default: None
    descp: integer or float, optional default is None The maximum number of patches
      to extract. If max_patches is a float between 0 and 1, it is taken to be a proportion
      of the total number of patches.
    dtype:
    - float
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
  patch_size:
    descp: tuple of ints (patch_height, patch_width) the dimensions of one patch
    dtype:
    - numeric
  random_state:
    default: None
    descp: int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None) Determines the
      random number generator used for random sampling when `max_patches` is not None.
      Use an int to make the randomness deterministic. See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.
