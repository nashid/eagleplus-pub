,"A function taking the `Tensor` containing the (dynamic) shape of the input tensor and returning a pair (scale, bias) to apply to the normalized values (before gamma and beta), only during training. For example, if axis==-1,`adjustment = lambda shape: (   tf.random.uniform(shape[-1:], 0.93, 1.07),   tf.random.uniform(shape[-1:], -0.1, 0.1))`will scale the normalized value by up to 7% up or down, then shift the result by up to 0.1 (with independent scaling and bias for each feature but shared across all examples), and finally apply gamma and/or beta. If`None`, no adjustment is applied. Cannot be specified if virtual_batch_size is specified.",None,prim_dtype,dtype(callable),,1
