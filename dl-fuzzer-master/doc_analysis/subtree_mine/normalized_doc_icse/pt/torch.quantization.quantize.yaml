constraints:
  inplace:
    default: 'False'
    descp: carry out model transformations in-place, the original module is mutated
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_descp:
    - carry out PARAM transformations in place the original module is mutated
  mapping:
    default: None
    descp: correspondence between original module types and quantized counterparts
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - correspondence between original module types and quantized counterparts
