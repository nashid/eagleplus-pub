constraints:
  output_size:
    descp: the target output size of the image of the form H x W. Can be a tuple (H,
      W) or a single H for a square image H x H. H and W can be either a `int`, or
      `None` which means the size will be the same as that of the input.
    sig_dtype: Union[T,Tuple[T,...]]
inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - output_size
