aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.argsort
constraints:
  axis:
    default: '-1'
    descp: The axis along which to sort. The default is -1, which sorts the last axis.
  direction:
    default: ASCENDING
    descp: The direction in which to sort the values ('ASCENDING' or 'DESCENDING').
  name:
    default: None
    descp: Optional name for the operation.
  stable:
    default: 'False'
    descp: If True, equal elements in the original tensor will not be re-ordered in
      the returned order. Unstable sort is not yet implemented, but will eventually
      be the default for performance reasons. If you require a stable order, pass
      stable=True for forwards compatibility.
  values:
    descp: 1-D or higher numeric Tensor.
exceptions:
- ValueError: If axis is not a constant scalar, or the direction is invalid.
inputs:
  optional:
  - axis
  - direction
  - stable
  - name
  required:
  - values

outputs:
- An int32 Tensor with the same shape as values. The indices that would sort each
  slice of the given values along the given axis.
