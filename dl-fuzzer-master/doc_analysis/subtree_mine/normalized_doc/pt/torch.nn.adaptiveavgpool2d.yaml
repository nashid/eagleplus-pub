constraints:
  output_size:
    descp: the target output size of the image of the form H x W. Can be a tuple (H,
      W) or a single H for a square image H x H. H and W can be either a `int`, or
      `None` which means the size will be the same as that of the input.
    normalized_descp:
    - the target output size of the image of the form H x W Can be a D_STRUCTURE BSTR
      or a single H for a square image H x H H and W can be either a D_TYPE, or QSTR
      which means the size will be the same as that of the input
inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - output_size
