constraints:
  maxvals:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as means. The maximum cutoff. May be
      +infinity, and must be more than the minval for each batch.
  means:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, float32, float64.
      The mean parameter of each batch.'
  minvals:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as means. The minimum cutoff. May be
      -infinity.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  seed:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. 2 seeds (shape
      [2]).'
  shape:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. The shape
      of the output tensor.'
  stddevs:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as means. The standard deviation parameter
      of each batch. Must be greater than 0.
