constraints:
  input:
    descp: A Tensor. A tensor that will be linearized.
  layout:
    default: '[]'
    descp: An optional list of ints. Defaults to []. A vector holding the requested
      layout in minor-to-major sequence. If a layout attribute is passed but its values
      are all -1 the layout will be computed by the infeed operation.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  shape:
    default: '[]'
    descp: An optional tf.TensorShape or list of ints. Defaults to []. The shape of
      the tensor.
inputs:
  optional:
  - shape
  - layout
  - name
  required:
  - input
