constraints:
  batch_axis:
    default: None
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. The dimension along which reversal is performed.
  input:
    descp: A Tensor. The input to reverse.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  seq_axis:
    default: None
    descp: An int. The dimension which is partially reversed.
  seq_lengths:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. 1-D with length
      input.dims(batch_axis) and max(seq_lengths) <= input.dims(seq_axis)'
inputs:
  optional:
  - seq_axis
  - batch_axis
  - name
  required:
  - input
  - seq_lengths
