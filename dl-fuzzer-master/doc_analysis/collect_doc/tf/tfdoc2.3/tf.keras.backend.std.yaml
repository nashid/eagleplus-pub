aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.keras.backend.std
constraints:
  axis:
    default: None
    descp: An integer, the axis to compute the standard deviation. If None (the default),
      reduces all dimensions. Must be in the range [-rank(x), rank(x)).
  keepdims:
    default: 'False'
    descp: A boolean, whether to keep the dimensions or not. If keepdims is False,
      the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1. If keepdims is True, the reduced dimension
      is retained with length 1.
  x:
    descp: A tensor or variable. It should have numerical dtypes. Boolean type inputs
      will be converted to float.
inputs:
  optional:
  - axis
  - keepdims
  required:
  - x
link: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/keras/backend/std
outputs:
- A tensor with the standard deviation of elements of x with same dtype. Boolean type
  input will be converted to float.
