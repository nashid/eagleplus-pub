constraints:
  a:
    descp: Input data. The histogram is computed over the flattened array.
    doc_dtype:
    - NDArray
  bins:
    default: '10'
    descp: If bins is an int, it defines the number of equal-width bins in the given
      range (10, by default). If bins is a sequence, it defines the bin edges, including
      the rightmost edge, allowing for non-uniform bin widths.
    doc_dtype:
    - int
    - sequence of scalars
  range:
    default: None
    descp: The lower and upper range of the bins. If not provided, range is simply
      (a.min(), a.max()). Values outside the range are ignored. The first element
      of the range must be less than or equal to the second. range affects the automatic
      bin computation as well, the range will be equally divided by the number of
      bins.
    doc_dtype:
    - (float, float)
