constraints:
  batch_size:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. A scalar representing the number of elements to
      accumulate in a batch.
  input_dataset:
    descp: A Tensor of type variant.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_shapes:
    descp: A list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints) that has length
      >= 1.
  padded_shapes:
    descp: A list of at least 1 Tensor objects with type int64. A list of int64 tensors
      representing the desired padded shapes of the corresponding output components.
      These shapes may be partially specified, using -1 to indicate that a particular
      dimension should be padded to the maximum size of all batch elements.
  padding_values:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects. A list of scalars containing the padding value
      to use for each of the outputs.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - input_dataset
  - batch_size
  - padded_shapes
  - padding_values
  - output_shapes
