constraints:
  alpha:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64, int32,
      uint8, int16, int8, complex64, int64, qint8, quint8, qint32, bfloat16, uint16,
      complex128, half, uint32, uint64. Scaling factor. Must be a scalar.'
  delta:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as alpha. The change.
  l1:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as alpha. L1 regularization. Must be
      a scalar.
  l2:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as alpha. L2 regularization. Must be
      a scalar.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  use_locking:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. If True, the subtraction will be protected
      by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.
  var:
    descp: A Tensor of type resource. Should be from a Variable().
inputs:

  - use_locking
