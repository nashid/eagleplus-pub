constraints:
  compression:
    default: None
    descp: Optional. The algorithm to use to compress data when writing it. Supported
      options are GZIP and NONE. Defaults to NONE.
  dataset:
    descp: The dataset to save.
  path:
    descp: Required. A directory to use for saving the dataset.
  shard_func:
    default: None
    descp: Optional. A function to control the mapping of dataset elements to file
      shards. The function is expected to map elements of the input dataset to int64
      shard IDs. If present, the function will be traced and executed as graph computation.
inputs:
  optional:
  - compression
  - shard_func
  required:
  - dataset
