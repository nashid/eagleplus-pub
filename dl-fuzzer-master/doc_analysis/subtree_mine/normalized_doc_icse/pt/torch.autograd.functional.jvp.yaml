constraints:
  create_graph:
    default: 'False'
    descp: If `True`, both the output and result will be computed in a differentiable
      way. Note that when `strict` is `False`, the result can not require gradients
      or be disconnected from the inputs. Defaults to `False`.
    doc_dtype: bool, optional
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_descp:
    - If CONSTANT_BOOL both the output and result will be computed in a differentiable
      way
    - Note that when PARAM is CONSTANT_BOOL the result can not require gradients or
      be disconnected from the PARAM
    - Defaults to CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_docdtype: D_TYPE optional
  func:
    descp: a Python function that takes Tensor inputs and returns a tuple of Tensors
      or a Tensor.
    doc_dtype: function
    normalized_descp:
    - a Python function that takes D_STRUCTURE PARAM and returns a D_STRUCTURE of
      D_STRUCTURE
    normalized_docdtype: ONE_WORD function
  inputs:
    descp: inputs to the function `func`.
    doc_dtype: tuple of Tensors or Tensor
    normalized_descp:
    - inputs to the function PARAM
    normalized_docdtype: D_STRUCTURE of D_STRUCTURE
  strict:
    default: 'False'
    descp: If `True`, an error will be raised when we detect that there exists an
      input such that all the outputs are independent of it. If `False`, we return
      a Tensor of zeros as the jvp for said inputs, which is the expected mathematical
      value. Defaults to `False`.
    doc_dtype: bool, optional
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_descp:
    - If CONSTANT_BOOL an error will be raised when we detect that there exists an
      input such that all the outputs are independent of it
    - If CONSTANT_BOOL we return a D_STRUCTURE of zeros as the jvp for said PARAM
      which is the expected mathematical value
    - Defaults to CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_docdtype: D_TYPE optional
  v:
    default: None
    descp: The vector for which the Jacobian vector product is computed. Must be the
      same size as the input of `func`. This argument is optional when `func`'s input
      contains a single element and (if it is not provided) will be set as a Tensor
      containing a single `1`.
    doc_dtype: tuple of Tensors or Tensor
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - The vector for which the Jacobian vector product is computed
    - Must be the same size as the input of PARAM
    - This argument is optional when PARAMs input contains a single element and BSTR
      will be set as a D_STRUCTURE containing a single CONSTANT_NUM
    normalized_docdtype: D_STRUCTURE of D_STRUCTURE
inputs:
  optional:
  - v
  - create_graph
  - strict
  required:
  - func
  - inputs
