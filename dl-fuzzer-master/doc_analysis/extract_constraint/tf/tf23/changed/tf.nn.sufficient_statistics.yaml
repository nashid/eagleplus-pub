constraints:
  axes:
    descp: Array of ints. Axes along which to compute mean and variance.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '1'
    structure:
    - list(int)
  keepdims:
    default: 'False'
    descp: produce statistics with the same dimensionality as the input.
    dtype:
    - tf.bool
    ndim:
    - '0'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: Name used to scope the operations that compute the sufficient stats.
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  shift:
    default: None
    descp: A Tensor containing the value by which to shift the data for numerical
      stability, or None if no shift is to be performed. A shift close to the true
      mean provides the most numerically stable results.
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  x:
    descp: A Tensor.
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
inputs:
  optional:
  - shift
  - keepdims
  - name
  required:
  - x
  - axes

outputs:
- 'Four Tensor objects of the same type as x: the count (number of elements to average
  over). the (possibly shifted) sum of the elements in the array. the (possibly shifted)
  sum of squares of the elements in the array. the shift by which the mean must be
  corrected or None if shift is None.'
