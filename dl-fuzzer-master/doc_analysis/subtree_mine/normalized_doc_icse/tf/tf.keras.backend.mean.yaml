aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.keras.backend.mean
constraints:
  axis:
    default: None
    descp: A list of integer. Axes to compute the mean.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE of D_TYPE
    - Axes to compute the mean
  keepdims:
    default: 'False'
    descp: A boolean, whether to keep the dimensions or not. If `keepdims` is `False`,
      the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each entry in `axis`. If `keepdims`
      is `True`, the reduced dimensions are retained with length 1.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE whether to keep the dimensions or not
    - If QSTR is CONSTANT_BOOL the rank of the D_STRUCTURE is reduced by CONSTANT_NUM
      for each entry in PARAM
    - If QSTR is CONSTANT_BOOL the reduced dimensions are retained with length CONSTANT_NUM
  x:
    descp: A tensor or variable.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE or variable
inputs:
  optional:
  - axis
  - keepdims

  - x
