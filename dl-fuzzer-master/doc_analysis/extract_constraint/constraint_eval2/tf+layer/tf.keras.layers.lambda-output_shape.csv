,"Expected output shape from function. This argument can be inferred if not explicitly provided. Can be a tuple or function. If a tuple, it only specifies the first dimension onward; sample dimension is assumed either the same as the input: `output_shape = (input_shape[0], ) + output_shape` or, the input is `None` and the sample dimension is also `None`: `output_shape = (None, ) + output_shape` If a function, it specifies the entire shape as a function of the input shape: `output_shape = f(input_shape)`",None,,,0,0
