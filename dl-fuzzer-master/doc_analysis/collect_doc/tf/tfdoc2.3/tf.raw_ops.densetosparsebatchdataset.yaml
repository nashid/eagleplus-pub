constraints:
  batch_size:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. A scalar representing the number of elements to
      accumulate in a batch.
  input_dataset:
    descp: A Tensor of type variant. A handle to an input dataset. Must have a single
      component.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_shapes:
    descp: A list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints) that has length
      >= 1.
  output_types:
    descp: A list of tf.DTypes that has length >= 1.
  row_shape:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. A vector representing the dense shape of each row
      in the produced SparseTensor. The shape may be partially specified, using -1
      to indicate that a particular dimension should use the maximum size of all batch
      elements.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - input_dataset
  - batch_size
  - row_shape
  - output_types
