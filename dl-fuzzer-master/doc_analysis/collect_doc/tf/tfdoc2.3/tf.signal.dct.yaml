aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.signal.dct
- tf.compat.v1.spectral.dct
constraints:
  axis:
    default: '-1'
    descp: For future expansion. The axis to compute the DCT along. Must be -1.
  input:
    descp: A [..., samples] float32/float64 Tensor containing the signals to take
      the DCT of.
  n:
    default: None
    descp: The length of the transform. If length is less than sequence length, only
      the first n elements of the sequence are considered for the DCT. If n is greater
      than the sequence length, zeros are padded and then the DCT is computed as usual.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: An optional name for the operation.
  norm:
    default: None
    descp: The normalization to apply. None for no normalization or 'ortho' for orthonormal
      normalization.
  type:
    default: '2'
    descp: The DCT type to perform. Must be 1, 2, 3 or 4.
exceptions:
- ValueError: If type is not 1, 2, 3 or 4, axis is not -1, n is not None or greater
    than 0, or norm is not None or 'ortho'.
- ValueError: If type is 1 and norm is ortho.
inputs:
  optional:
  - type
  - n
  - axis
  - norm
  - name
  required:
  - input
