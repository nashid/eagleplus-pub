constraints:
  buckets:
    descp: The buckets to run the chi-square the test. Make sure that the buckets
      cover the whole range of the distribution. Also, the buckets must be in ascending
      order and have no intersection
    doc_dtype: list of tuple or list of number
    normalized_descp:
    - The buckets to run the chi square the test
    - Make sure that the buckets cover the whole range of the distribution
    - Also the buckets must be in ascending order and have no intersection
    normalized_docdtype: D_STRUCTURE of D_STRUCTURE of number
  generator:
    descp: A function that is assumed to generate i.i.d samples from a specific distribution.
      generator(N) should generate N random samples.
    doc_dtype: function
    normalized_descp:
    - A function that is assumed to generate i i d samples from a specific distribution
    - generator BSTR should generate N random samples
    normalized_docdtype: ONE_WORD function
  nsamples:
    default: '1000000'
    descp: The number of samples to generate for the testing
    doc_dtype: int
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_NUM
    normalized_descp:
    - The number of samples to generate for the testing
    normalized_docdtype: ONE_WORD D_TYPE
  probs:
    descp: The ground-truth probability of the random value fall in a specific bucket.
    doc_dtype: list or tuple
    normalized_descp:
    - The ground truth probability of the random value fall in a specific bucket
    normalized_docdtype: ONE_WORD D_STRUCTURE
inputs:
  optional:
  - nsamples
