constraints:
  batch_size:
    default: '32'
    descp: 'Size of the batches of data. Default: 32.'
  class_names:
    default: None
    descp: Only valid if "labels" is "inferred". This is the explict list of class
      names (must match names of subdirectories). Used to control the order of the
      classes (otherwise alphanumerical order is used).
  directory:
    descp: Directory where the data is located. If labels is "inferred", it should
      contain subdirectories, each containing text files for a class. Otherwise, the
      directory structure is ignored.
  follow_links:
    default: 'False'
    descp: Whether to visits subdirectories pointed to by symlinks. Defaults to False.
  label_mode:
    default: int
    descp: '''int'': means that the labels are encoded as integers (e.g. for sparse_categorical_crossentropy
      loss). ''categorical'' means that the labels are encoded as a categorical vector
      (e.g. for categorical_crossentropy loss). ''binary'' means that the labels (there
      can be only 2) are encoded as float32 scalars with values 0 or 1 (e.g. for binary_crossentropy).
      None (no labels).'
  labels:
    default: inferred
    descp: Either "inferred" (labels are generated from the directory structure),
      or a list/tuple of integer labels of the same size as the number of text files
      found in the directory. Labels should be sorted according to the alphanumeric
      order of the text file paths (obtained via os.walk(directory) in Python).
  max_length:
    default: None
    descp: Maximum size of a text string. Texts longer than this will be truncated
      to max_length.
  seed:
    default: None
    descp: Optional random seed for shuffling and transformations.
  shuffle:
    default: 'True'
    descp: 'Whether to shuffle the data. Default: True. If set to False, sorts the
      data in alphanumeric order.'
  subset:
    default: None
    descp: One of "training" or "validation". Only used if validation_split is set.
  validation_split:
    default: None
    descp: Optional float between 0 and 1, fraction of data to reserve for validation.

outputs:
- A tf.data.Dataset object. If label_mode is None, it yields string tensors of shape
  (batch_size,), containing the contents of a batch of text files. Otherwise, it yields
  a tuple (texts, labels), where texts has shape (batch_size,) and labels follows
  the format described below.
