constraints:
  X:
    descp: array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features) Data from which to compute the
      covariance estimate.
    ndim:
    - '2'
    shape:
    - '[n_samples,n_features]'
  assume_centered:
    default: 'False'
    descp: boolean If True, data will not be centered before computation. Useful to
      work with data whose mean is significantly equal to zero but is not exactly
      zero. If False, data will be centered before computation.
