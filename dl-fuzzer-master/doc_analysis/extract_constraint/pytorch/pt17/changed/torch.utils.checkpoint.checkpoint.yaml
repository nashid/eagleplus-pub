constraints:
  '**kwargs':
    descp: ''
  '*args':
    descp: tuple containing inputs to the `function`
  function:
    descp: describes what to run in the forward pass of the model or part of the model.
      It should also know how to handle the inputs passed as the tuple. For example,
      in LSTM, if user passes `(activation, hidden)`, `function` should correctly
      use the first input as `activation` and the second input as `hidden`
    dtype:
    - callable
  preserve_rng_state:
    default: None
    descp: Omit stashing and restoring the RNG state during each checkpoint.
    doc_dtype:
    - bool
    - default=True
    dtype:
    - torch.bool
inputs:
  optional:
  - preserve_rng_state
  required:
  - function
  - '*args'
  - '**kwargs'
