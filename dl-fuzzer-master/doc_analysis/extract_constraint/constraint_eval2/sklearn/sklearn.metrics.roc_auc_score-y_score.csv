In the binary and multilabel cases, these can be either probability estimates or non-thresholded decision values (as returned by `decision_function` on some classifiers). In the multiclass case, these must be probability estimates which sum to 1. The binary case expects a shape (n_samples,), and the scores must be the scores of the class with the greater label. The multiclass and multilabel cases expect a shape (n_samples, n_classes).
