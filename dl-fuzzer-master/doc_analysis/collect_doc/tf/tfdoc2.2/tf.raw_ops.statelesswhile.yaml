constraints:
  body:
    descp: A function decorated with @Defun. A function that takes a list of tensors
      and returns another list of tensors. Both lists have the same types as specified
      by T.
  cond:
    descp: 'A function decorated with @Defun. A function takes ''input'' and returns
      a tensor. If the tensor is a scalar of non-boolean, the scalar is converted
      to a boolean according to the following rule: if the scalar is a numerical value,
      non-zero means True and zero means False; if the scalar is a string, non-empty
      means True and empty means False. If the tensor is not a scalar, non-emptiness
      means True and False otherwise. This should only be used when the while condition
      and body functions do not have stateful ops.'
  input:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects. A list of input tensors whose types are T.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_shapes:
    default: '[]'
    descp: An optional list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints). Defaults
      to [].
  parallel_iterations:
    default: '10'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 10.
inputs:
  optional:
  - output_shapes
  - parallel_iterations
  - name
