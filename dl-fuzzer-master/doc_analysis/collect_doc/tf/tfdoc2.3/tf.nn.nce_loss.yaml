constraints:
  biases:
    descp: A Tensor of shape [num_classes]. The class biases.
  inputs:
    descp: A Tensor of shape [batch_size, dim]. The forward activations of the input
      network.
  labels:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64 and shape [batch_size, num_true]. The target classes.
  name:
    default: nce_loss
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  num_classes:
    descp: An int. The number of possible classes.
  num_sampled:
    descp: An int. The number of negative classes to randomly sample per batch. This
      single sample of negative classes is evaluated for each element in the batch.
  num_true:
    default: '1'
    descp: An int. The number of target classes per training example.
  remove_accidental_hits:
    default: 'False'
    descp: A bool. Whether to remove "accidental hits" where a sampled class equals
      one of the target classes. If set to True, this is a "Sampled Logistic" loss
      instead of NCE, and we are learning to generate log-odds instead of log probabilities.
      See our Candidate Sampling Algorithms Reference. Default is False.
  sampled_values:
    default: None
    descp: a tuple of (sampled_candidates, true_expected_count, sampled_expected_count)
      returned by a *_candidate_sampler function. (if None, we default to log_uniform_candidate_sampler)
  weights:
    descp: A Tensor of shape [num_classes, dim], or a list of Tensor objects whose
      concatenation along dimension 0 has shape [num_classes, dim]. The (possibly-partitioned)
      class embeddings.

  optional:
  - num_true
  - sampled_values

  - name
  required:
