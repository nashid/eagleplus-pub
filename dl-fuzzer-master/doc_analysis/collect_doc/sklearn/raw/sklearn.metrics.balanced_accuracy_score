sklearn.metrics.balanced_accuracy_score = balanced_accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=None, adjusted=False)
    Compute the balanced accuracy
    
    The balanced accuracy in binary and multiclass classification problems to
    deal with imbalanced datasets. It is defined as the average of recall
    obtained on each class.
    
    The best value is 1 and the worst value is 0 when ``adjusted=False``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : 1d array-like
        Ground truth (correct) target values.
    
    y_pred : 1d array-like
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.
    
    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.
    
    adjusted : bool, default=False
        When true, the result is adjusted for chance, so that random
        performance would score 0, and perfect performance scores 1.
    
    Returns
    -------
    balanced_accuracy : float

    Notes
    -----
    Some literature promotes alternative definitions of balanced accuracy. Our
    definition is equivalent to :func:`accuracy_score` with class-balanced
    sample weights, and shares desirable properties with the binary case.
    See the :ref:`User Guide <balanced_accuracy_score>`.
