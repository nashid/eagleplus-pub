constraints:
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  ref:
    descp: 'A mutable Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64,
      int32, uint8, int16, int8, complex64, int64, qint8, quint8, qint32, bfloat16,
      uint16, complex128, half, uint32, uint64. Should be from a Variable node.'
  use_locking:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. If True, the subtraction will be protected
      by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.
  value:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as ref. The value to be subtracted to
      the variable.

  - use_locking
