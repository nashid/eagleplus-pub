constraints:
  beta:

    descp: A Tensor of type float32. The value represented by the lowest quantized
      offset.
  gamma:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as t. A 1D gamma Tensor with size matching

      with gamma.
  t:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: qint8, quint8, qint32, qint16,
      quint16. A 4D input Tensor.'

    descp: A Tensor of type float32. The value represented by the highest quantized
      input.
  t_min:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. The value represented by the lowest quantized
      input.
  v:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as t. A 1D variance Tensor with size
      matching the last dimension of t. This is the second output from tf.nn.moments,

    descp: A Tensor of type float32. The value represented by the highest quantized
      variance.
  v_min:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. The value represented by the lowest quantized
      variance.
