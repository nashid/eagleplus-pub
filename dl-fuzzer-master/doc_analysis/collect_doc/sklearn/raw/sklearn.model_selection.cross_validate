sklearn.model_selection.cross_validate = cross_validate(estimator, X, y=None, groups=None, scoring=None, cv=None, n_jobs=None, verbose=0, fit_params=None, pre_dispatch='2*n_jobs', return_train_score=False, return_estimator=False, error_score=nan)
    Evaluate metric(s) by cross-validation and also record fit/score times.
    
    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <multimetric_cross_validation>`.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator object implementing 'fit'
        The object to use to fit the data.
    
    X : array-like
        The data to fit. Can be for example a list, or an array.
    
    y : array-like, optional, default: None
        The target variable to try to predict in the case of
        supervised learning.
    
    groups : array-like, with shape (n_samples,), optional
        Group labels for the samples used while splitting the dataset into
        train/test set. Only used in conjunction with a "Group" :term:`cv`
        instance (e.g., :class:`GroupKFold`).
    
    scoring : string, callable, list/tuple, dict or None, default: None
        A single string (see :ref:`scoring_parameter`) or a callable
        (see :ref:`scoring`) to evaluate the predictions on the test set.
    
        For evaluating multiple metrics, either give a list of (unique) strings
        or a dict with names as keys and callables as values.
    
        NOTE that when using custom scorers, each scorer should return a single
        value. Metric functions returning a list/array of values can be wrapped
        into multiple scorers that return one value each.
    
        See :ref:`multimetric_grid_search` for an example.
    
        If None, the estimator's score method is used.
    
    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, optional
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:
    
        - None, to use the default 5-fold cross validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds in a `(Stratified)KFold`,
        - :term:`CV splitter`,
        - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.
    
        For integer/None inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` is used. In all
        other cases, :class:`KFold` is used.
    
        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.
    
        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            ``cv`` default value if None changed from 3-fold to 5-fold.
    
    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of CPUs to use to do the computation.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.
    
    verbose : integer, optional
        The verbosity level.
    
    fit_params : dict, optional
        Parameters to pass to the fit method of the estimator.
    
    pre_dispatch : int, or string, optional
        Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
        execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
        explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
        than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:
    
            - None, in which case all the jobs are immediately
              created and spawned. Use this for lightweight and
              fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
              spawning of the jobs
    
            - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
              spawned
    
            - A string, giving an expression as a function of n_jobs,
              as in '2*n_jobs'
    
    return_train_score : boolean, default=False
        Whether to include train scores.
        Computing training scores is used to get insights on how different
        parameter settings impact the overfitting/underfitting trade-off.
        However computing the scores on the training set can be computationally
        expensive and is not strictly required to select the parameters that
        yield the best generalization performance.
    
    return_estimator : boolean, default False
        Whether to return the estimators fitted on each split.
    
    error_score : 'raise' or numeric
        Value to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting.
        If set to 'raise', the error is raised.
        If a numeric value is given, FitFailedWarning is raised. This parameter
        does not affect the refit step, which will always raise the error.
    
    Returns
    -------
    scores : dict of float arrays of shape (n_splits,)
        Array of scores of the estimator for each run of the cross validation.
    
        A dict of arrays containing the score/time arrays for each scorer is
        returned. The possible keys for this ``dict`` are:
    
            ``test_score``
                The score array for test scores on each cv split.
                Suffix ``_score`` in ``test_score`` changes to a specific
                metric like ``test_r2`` or ``test_auc`` if there are
                multiple scoring metrics in the scoring parameter.
            ``train_score``
                The score array for train scores on each cv split.
                Suffix ``_score`` in ``train_score`` changes to a specific
                metric like ``train_r2`` or ``train_auc`` if there are
                multiple scoring metrics in the scoring parameter.
                This is available only if ``return_train_score`` parameter
                is ``True``.
            ``fit_time``
                The time for fitting the estimator on the train
                set for each cv split.
            ``score_time``
                The time for scoring the estimator on the test set for each
                cv split. (Note time for scoring on the train set is not
                included even if ``return_train_score`` is set to ``True``
            ``estimator``
                The estimator objects for each cv split.
                This is available only if ``return_estimator`` parameter
                is set to ``True``.
