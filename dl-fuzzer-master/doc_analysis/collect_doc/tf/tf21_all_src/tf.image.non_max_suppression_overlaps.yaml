aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.image.non_max_suppression_overlaps
constraints:
  max_output_size:
    descp: A scalar integer `Tensor` representing the maximum number of boxes to be
      selected by non max suppression.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  overlap_threshold:
    default: '0.5'
    descp: A float representing the threshold for deciding whether boxes overlap too
      much with respect to the provided overlap values.
  overlaps:
    descp: A 2-D float `Tensor` of shape `[num_boxes, num_boxes]`.
  score_threshold:
    default: float(-inf)
    descp: A float representing the threshold for deciding when to remove boxes based
      on score.
  scores:
    descp: A 1-D float `Tensor` of shape `[num_boxes]` representing a single score
      corresponding to each box (each row of boxes).
inputs:
  optional:
  - overlap_threshold
  - score_threshold
  - name
  required:
  - overlaps
  - scores
  - max_output_size

outputs:
- selected_indices: A 1-D integer `Tensor` of shape `[M]` representing the selected
    indices from the overlaps tensor, where `M <= max_output_size`.
