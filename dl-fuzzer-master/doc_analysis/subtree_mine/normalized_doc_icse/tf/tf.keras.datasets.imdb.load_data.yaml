    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - sequences longer than this will be filtered out
  num_words:
    default: None
    descp: max number of words to include. Words are ranked by how often they occur
      (in the training set) and only the most frequent words are kept
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - max number of words to include
    - Words are ranked by how often they occur BSTR and only the most frequent words
      are kept
  oov_char:
    default: '2'
    descp: words that were cut out because of the `num_words`or `skip_top` limit will
      be replaced with this character.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_NUM
    normalized_descp:
    - words that were cut out because of the PARAMor PARAM limit will be replaced

  path:
    default: imdb.npz
    descp: where to cache the data (relative to `~/.keras/dataset`).
    normalized_default: imdb npz
    normalized_descp:
    - where to cache the data relative to keras dataset
  seed:
    default: '113'
    descp: random seed for sample shuffling.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_NUM
    normalized_descp:
    - random seed for sample shuffling
  skip_top:
    default: '0'
    descp: skip the top N most frequently occurring words (which may not be informative).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_NUM
    normalized_descp:
    - skip the top N most frequently occurring words BSTR
  start_char:
    default: '1'
    descp: The start of a sequence will be marked with this character. Set to 1 because
      0 is usually the padding character.

    normalized_descp:
    - The start of a D_STRUCTURE will be marked with this character
    - Set to CONSTANT_NUM because CONSTANT_NUM is usually the padding character
exceptions:
- ValueError: in case `maxlen` is so low that no input sequence could be kept.
