  strides:
    descp: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `3` or `5`.  The stride of
      the sliding window for each dimension of `input`. If a single value is given
      it is replicated in the `D`, `H` and `W` dimension. By default the `N` and `C`
      dimensions are set to 0. The dimension order is determined by the value of `data_format`,
      see below for details.
