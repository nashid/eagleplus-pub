,"Optional `Recurrent` instance to be used to handle backwards input processing. If `backward_layer` is not provided, the layer instance passed as the `layer` argument will be used to generate the backward layer automatically. Note that the provided `backward_layer` layer should have properties matching those of the `layer` argument, in particular it should have the same values for `stateful`, `return_states`, `return_sequence`, etc. In addition, `backward_layer` and `layer` should have different `go_backwards` argument values. A `ValueError` will be raised if these requirements are not met.",None,,,0,0
