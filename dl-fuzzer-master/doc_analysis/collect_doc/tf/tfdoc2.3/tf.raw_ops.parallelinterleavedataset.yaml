constraints:
  block_length:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. Number of elements at a time to produce from each
      interleaved invocation of a dataset returned by f.
  buffer_output_elements:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. The number of elements each iterator being interleaved
      should buffer (similar to the .prefetch() transformation for each interleaved
      iterator).
  cycle_length:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. Number of datasets (each created by applying f
      to the elements of input_dataset) among which the ParallelInterleaveDataset
      will cycle in a round-robin fashion.
  f:
    descp: A function decorated with @Defun. A function mapping elements of input_dataset,
      concatenated with other_arguments, to a Dataset variant that contains elements
      matching output_types and output_shapes.
  input_dataset:
    descp: A Tensor of type variant. Dataset that produces a stream of arguments for
      the function f.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  other_arguments:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects. Additional arguments to pass to f beyond those
      produced by input_dataset. Evaluated once when the dataset is instantiated.
  output_shapes:
    descp: A list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints) that has length
      >= 1.
  output_types:
    descp: A list of tf.DTypes that has length >= 1.
  prefetch_input_elements:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. Determines the number of iterators to prefetch,
      allowing buffers to warm up and data to be pre-fetched without blocking the
      main thread.
  sloppy:
    descp: A Tensor of type bool. If True, return elements as they become available,
      even if that means returning these elements in a non-deterministic order. Sloppy
      operation may result in better performance in the presence of stragglers, but
      the dataset will still block if all of its open streams are blocked. If False,
      always return elements in a deterministic order.
