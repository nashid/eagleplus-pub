,"string, [None, 'binary' (default), 'micro', 'macro', 'samples',                        'weighted'] This parameter is required for multiclass/multilabel targets. If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this determines the type of averaging performed on the data: ``'binary'``: Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``. This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary. ``'micro'``: Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives, false negatives and false positives. ``'macro'``: Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account. ``'weighted'``: Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted by support (the number of true instances for each label). This alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an F-score that is not between precision and recall. ``'samples'``: Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from :func:`accuracy_score`).",binary,prim_dtype,dtype(string),,1
