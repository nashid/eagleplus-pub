sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances_argmin_min = pairwise_distances_argmin_min(X, Y, axis=1, metric='euclidean', metric_kwargs=None)
    Compute minimum distances between one point and a set of points.
    
    This function computes for each row in X, the index of the row of Y which
    is closest (according to the specified distance). The minimal distances are
    also returned.
    
    This is mostly equivalent to calling:
    
        (pairwise_distances(X, Y=Y, metric=metric).argmin(axis=axis),
         pairwise_distances(X, Y=Y, metric=metric).min(axis=axis))
    
    but uses much less memory, and is faster for large arrays.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape (n_samples1, n_features)
        Array containing points.
    
    Y : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape (n_samples2, n_features)
        Arrays containing points.
    
    axis : int, optional, default 1
        Axis along which the argmin and distances are to be computed.
    
    metric : string or callable, default 'euclidean'
        metric to use for distance computation. Any metric from scikit-learn
        or scipy.spatial.distance can be used.
    
        If metric is a callable function, it is called on each
        pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable
        should take two arrays as input and return one value indicating the
        distance between them. This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less
        efficient than passing the metric name as a string.
    
        Distance matrices are not supported.
    
        Valid values for metric are:
    
        - from scikit-learn: ['cityblock', 'cosine', 'euclidean', 'l1', 'l2',
          'manhattan']
    
        - from scipy.spatial.distance: ['braycurtis', 'canberra', 'chebyshev',
          'correlation', 'dice', 'hamming', 'jaccard', 'kulsinski',
          'mahalanobis', 'minkowski', 'rogerstanimoto', 'russellrao',
          'seuclidean', 'sokalmichener', 'sokalsneath', 'sqeuclidean',
          'yule']
    
        See the documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these
        metrics.
    
    metric_kwargs : dict, optional
        Keyword arguments to pass to specified metric function.
    
    Returns
    -------
    argmin : numpy.ndarray
        Y[argmin[i], :] is the row in Y that is closest to X[i, :].
    
    distances : numpy.ndarray
        distances[i] is the distance between the i-th row in X and the
        argmin[i]-th row in Y.
