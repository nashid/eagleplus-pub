    descp: 4-D Tensor of shape [batch, height, width, channels] or 3-D Tensor of shape
      [height, width, channels].
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).

outputs:
- The total variation of images. If images was 4-D, return a 1-D float Tensor of shape
  [batch] with the total variation for each image in the batch. If images was 3-D,
  return a scalar float with the total variation for that image.
