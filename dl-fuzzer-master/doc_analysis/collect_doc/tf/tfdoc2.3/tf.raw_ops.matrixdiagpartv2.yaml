constraints:
  input:
    descp: A Tensor. Rank r tensor where r >= 2.
  k:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. Diagonal offset(s). Positive value means superdiagonal,
      0 refers to the main diagonal, and negative value means subdiagonals. k can
      be a single integer (for a single diagonal) or a pair of integers specifying
      the low and high ends of a matrix band. k[0] must not be larger than k[1].
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  padding_value:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as input. The value to fill the area
      outside the specified diagonal band with. Default is 0.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - input
  - k
  - padding_value
