constraints:
  core_distances:
    descp: array, shape (n_samples,) Distances at which points become core (``core_distances_``)
  eps:
    descp: float DBSCAN ``eps`` parameter. Must be set to < ``max_eps``. Results will
      be close to DBSCAN algorithm if ``eps`` and ``max_eps`` are close to one another.
    dtype:
    - float
    ndim:
    - '0'
  ordering:
    descp: array, shape (n_samples,) OPTICS ordered point indices (``ordering_``)
  reachability:
    descp: array, shape (n_samples,) Reachability distances calculated by OPTICS (``reachability_``)
inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - reachability
  - core_distances
  - ordering
  - eps
