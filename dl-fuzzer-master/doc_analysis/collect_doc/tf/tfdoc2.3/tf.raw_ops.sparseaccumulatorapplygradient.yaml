constraints:
  gradient_indices:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. Indices of the sparse gradient to be accumulated.
      Must be a vector.
  gradient_shape:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. Shape of the sparse gradient to be accumulated.
  gradient_values:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64, int32,
      uint8, int16, int8, complex64, int64, qint8, quint8, qint32, bfloat16, uint16,
      complex128, half, uint32, uint64. Values are the non-zero slices of the gradient,
      and must have the same first dimension as indices, i.e., the nnz represented
      by indices and values must be consistent.'
  handle:
    descp: A Tensor of type mutable string. The handle to a accumulator.
  has_known_shape:
    descp: A bool. Boolean indicating whether gradient_shape is unknown, in which
      case the input is ignored during validation.
  local_step:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. The local_step value at which the sparse gradient
      was computed.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
