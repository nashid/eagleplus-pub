aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.data.experimental.scan
constraints:
  initial_state:
    descp: A nested structure of tensors, representing the initial state of the accumulator.
    normalized_descp:
    - A nested structure of D_STRUCTURE representing the initial state of the accumulator
  scan_func:
    descp: A function that maps `(old_state, input_element)` to`(new_state, output_element).
      It must take two arguments and return a pair of nested structures of tensors.
      The`new_state`must match the structure of`initial_state`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A function that maps BSTR to BSTR
    - It must take two arguments and return a pair of nested structures of D_STRUCTURE
    - The QSTR must match the structure of PARAM
inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - initial_state
  - scan_func
