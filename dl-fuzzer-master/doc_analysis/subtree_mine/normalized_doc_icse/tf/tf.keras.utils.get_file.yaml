- tf.compat.v1.keras.utils.get_file
constraints:
  archive_format:
    default: auto
    descp: Archive format to try for extracting the file. Options are 'auto', 'tar',
      'zip', and None. 'tar' includes tar, tar.gz, and tar.bz files. The default 'auto'
      is ['tar', 'zip']. None or an empty list will return no matches found.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - Archive format to try for extracting the file
    - Options are QSTR and None
    - QSTR includes tar tar gz and tar bz files
    - The default QSTR is QSTR
    - None or an empty D_STRUCTURE will return no matches found
  cache_dir:
    default: None
    descp: Location to store cached files, when None it defaults to the Keras   Directory.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Location to store cached files when None it defaults to the Keras Directory
  cache_subdir:
    default: datasets
    descp: Subdirectory under the Keras cache dir where the file is saved. If an absolute
      path `/path/to/folder` is specified the file will be saved at that location.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - Subdirectory under the Keras cache dir where the file is saved
    - If an absolute path path to folder is specified the file will be saved at that
      location
  extract:
    default: 'False'
    descp: True tries extracting the file as an Archive, like tar or zip.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_descp:
    - CONSTANT_BOOL tries extracting the file as an Archive like tar or zip
  file_hash:
    default: None
    descp: The expected hash string of the file after download. The sha256 and md5
      hash algorithms are both supported.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - The expected hash D_TYPE of the file after download
    - The sha256 and md5 hash algorithms are both supported
  fname:
    descp: Name of the file. If an absolute path `/path/to/file.txt` is specified
      the file will be saved at that location.
    normalized_descp:
    - Name of the file
    - If an absolute path path to file txt is specified the file will be saved at
      that location
  hash_algorithm:
    default: auto
    descp: Select the hash algorithm to verify the file. options are 'md5', 'sha256',
      and 'auto'. The default 'auto' detects the hash algorithm in use.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - Select the hash algorithm to verify the file
    - options are QSTR
    - The default QSTR detects the hash algorithm in use
  md5_hash:
    default: None
    descp: Deprecated in favor of 'file_hash'. md5 hash of the file for verification
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Deprecated in favor of PARAM
    - md5 hash of the file for verification
  origin:
    descp: Original URL of the file.
    normalized_descp:
    - Original URL of the file
  untar:
    default: 'False'
    descp: Deprecated in favor of 'extract'. boolean, whether the file should be decompressed
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_descp:
    - Deprecated in favor of PARAM
    - D_TYPE whether the file should be decompressed
inputs:
  optional:
  - untar
  - md5_hash
  - file_hash
  - cache_subdir
  - hash_algorithm
  - extract
  - archive_format
  - cache_dir
