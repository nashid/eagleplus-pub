  condition:
    descp: A Tensor of type bool.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  x:
    descp: A Tensor which may have the same shape as condition. If condition is rank
      1, x may have higher rank, but its first dimension must match the size of condition.
  y:
    descp: A Tensor with the same type and shape as x.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - condition
