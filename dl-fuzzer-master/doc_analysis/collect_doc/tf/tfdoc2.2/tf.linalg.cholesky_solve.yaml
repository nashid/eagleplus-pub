aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.cholesky_solve
- tf.compat.v1.linalg.cholesky_solve
constraints:
  chol:
    descp: A Tensor. Must be float32 or float64, shape is [..., M, M]. Cholesky factorization
      of A, e.g. chol = tf.linalg.cholesky(A). For that reason, only the lower triangular
      parts (including the diagonal) of the last two dimensions of chol are used.
      The strictly upper part is assumed to be zero and not accessed.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name to give this Op. Defaults to cholesky_solve.
  rhs:
    descp: A Tensor, same type as chol, shape is [..., M, K].
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - chol
  - rhs

outputs:
- Solution to A x = rhs, shape [..., M, K].
