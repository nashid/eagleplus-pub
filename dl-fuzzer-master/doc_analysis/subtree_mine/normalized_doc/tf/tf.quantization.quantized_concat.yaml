constraints:
  concat_dim:
    descp: A `Tensor` of type `int32`. 0-D.  The dimension along which to concatenate.  Must
      be in the range [0, rank(values)).
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE of type D_TYPE
    - CONSTANT_NUM D
    - The dimension along which to concatenate
    - Must be in the range BSTR
  input_maxes:
    descp: A list with the same length as `values` of `Tensor` objects with type `float32`.
      The maximum scalar values for each of the input tensors.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE with the same length as PARAM of D_STRUCTURE objects with type
      D_TYPE
    - The maximum scalar PARAM for each of the input D_STRUCTURE
  input_mins:
    descp: A list with the same length as `values` of `Tensor` objects with type `float32`.
      The minimum scalar values for each of the input tensors.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE with the same length as PARAM of D_STRUCTURE objects with type
      D_TYPE
    - The minimum scalar PARAM for each of the input D_STRUCTURE
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for the operation BSTR
  values:
    descp: A list of at least 2 `Tensor` objects with the same type. The `N` Tensors
      to concatenate. Their ranks and types must match, and their sizes must match
      in all dimensions except `concat_dim`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE of at least CONSTANT_NUM D_STRUCTURE objects with the same type
    - The QSTR D_STRUCTURE to concatenate
    - Their ranks and types must match, and their sizes must match in all dimensions
      except PARAM
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - concat_dim
  - values
  - input_mins
  - input_maxes
