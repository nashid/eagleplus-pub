constraints:
  axis:
    default: '-1'
    descp: The class dimension. Defaulted to -1 which is the last dimension.
  labels:
    descp: Each vector along the class dimension should hold a valid probability distribution
      e.g. for the case in which labels are of shape [batch_size, num_classes], each
      row of labels[i] must be a valid probability distribution.
  logits:
    descp: Per-label activations, typically a linear output. These activation energies
      are interpreted as unnormalized log probabilities.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
inputs:
  optional:
  - axis
  - name
  required:
  - labels
  - logits

outputs: A Tensor that contains the softmax cross entropy loss. Its type is the same
  as logits and its shape is the same as labels except that it does not have the last
  dimension of labels.
