aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.random.experimental.stateless_fold_in
constraints:
  data:
    descp: an int32 or int64 scalar representing data to be folded in to the seed.
  seed:
    descp: an RNG seed (a tensor with shape [2] and dtype int32 or int64). (When using
      XLA, only int32 is allowed.)
inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - seed
  - data
link: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/random/experimental/stateless_fold_in
outputs:
- A new RNG seed that is a deterministic function of the inputs and is statistically
  safe for producing a stream of new pseudo-random values. It will have the same dtype
  as data (if data doesn't have an explict dtype, the dtype will be determined by
  tf.convert_to_tensor).
