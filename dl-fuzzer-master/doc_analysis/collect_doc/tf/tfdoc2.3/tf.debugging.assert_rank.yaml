constraints:
  message:
    default: None
    descp: A string to prefix to the default message.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for this operation (optional). Defaults to "assert_rank".
  rank:
    descp: Scalar integer Tensor.
  x:
    descp: Tensor.
exceptions:
- InvalidArgumentError: if the check can be performed immediately and x does not have
    rank rank. The check can be performed immediately during eager execution or if
    the shape of x is statically known.
inputs:
  optional:
  - message
  - name
  required:
  - x
  - rank

outputs:
- Op raising InvalidArgumentError unless x has specified rank. If static checks determine
  x has correct rank, a no_op is returned. This can be used with tf.control_dependencies
  inside of tf.functions to block followup computation until the check has executed.
