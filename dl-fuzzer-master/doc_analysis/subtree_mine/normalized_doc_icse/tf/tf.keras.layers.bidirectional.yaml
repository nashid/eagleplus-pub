    normalized_descp: []
  backward_layer:
    default: None
    descp: Optional `Recurrent` instance to be used to handle backwards input processing.
      If `backward_layer` is not provided, the layer instance passed as the `layer`
      argument will be used to generate the backward layer automatically. Note that
      the provided `backward_layer` layer should have properties matching those of
      the `layer` argument, in particular it should have the same values for `stateful`,
      `return_states`, `return_sequence`, etc. In addition, `backward_layer` and `layer`
      should have different `go_backwards` argument values. A `ValueError` will be
      raised if these requirements are not met.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Optional QSTR instance to be used to handle backwards input processing
    - If QSTR is not provided the PARAM instance passed as the PARAM argument will
      be used to generate the backward PARAM automatically
    - Note that the provided QSTR PARAM should have properties matching those of the
      PARAM argument in particular it should have the same values for QSTR etc
    - In addition QSTR and PARAM should have different QSTR argument values
    - A QSTR will be raised if these requirements are not met
