constraints:
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  new_vocab_file:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. Path to the new vocab file.
  new_vocab_offset:
    descp: An int that is >= 0. How many entries into the new vocab file to start
      reading.
  num_new_vocab:
    descp: An int that is >= 0. Number of entries in the new vocab file to remap.
  old_vocab_file:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. Path to the old vocab file.
  old_vocab_size:
    default: '-1'
    descp: An optional int that is >= -1. Defaults to -1. Number of entries in the
      old vocab file to consider. If -1, use the entire old vocabulary.
