constraints:
  axes:
    descp: Array of ints. Axes along which to compute mean and variance.
  keepdims:
    default: 'False'
    descp: produce moments with the same dimensionality as the input.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: Name used to scope the operations that compute the moments.
  shift:
    default: None
    descp: Not used in the current implementation.
  x:
    descp: A Tensor.
inputs:
  optional:
  - shift
  - keepdims
  - name
