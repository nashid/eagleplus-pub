constraints:
  ctc_merge_repeated:
    default: 'True'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to True. Scalar. If set to false, during CTC
      calculation repeated non-blank labels will not be merged and are interpreted
      as individual labels. This is a simplified version of CTC.
  ignore_longer_outputs_than_inputs:
    default: 'False'
    descp: 'An optional bool. Defaults to False. Scalar. If set to true, during CTC
      calculation, items that have longer output sequences than input sequences are
      skipped: they don''t contribute to the loss term and have zero-gradient.'
  inputs:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64. 3-D, shape:
      (max_time x batch_size x num_classes), the logits.'
  labels_indices:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. The indices of a SparseTensor<int32, 2>. labels_indices(i,
      :) == [b, t] means labels_values(i) stores the id for (batch b, time t).
  labels_values:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. The values (labels) associated with the given batch
      and time.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  preprocess_collapse_repeated:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. Scalar, if true then repeated labels
      are collapsed prior to the CTC calculation.
  sequence_length:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. A vector containing sequence lengths (batch).
inputs:
  optional:
  - preprocess_collapse_repeated
  - ctc_merge_repeated
  - ignore_longer_outputs_than_inputs
  - name
  required:
  - inputs
  - labels_indices
  - labels_values
  - sequence_length

outputs:
- A tuple of Tensor objects (loss, gradient).
- loss: A Tensor. Has the same type as inputs.
- gradient: A Tensor. Has the same type as inputs.
