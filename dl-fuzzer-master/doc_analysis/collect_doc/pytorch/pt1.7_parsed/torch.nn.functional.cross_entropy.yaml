constraints:
  ignore_index:
    default: '-100'
    descp: 'Specifies a target value that is ignored and does not contribute to the
      input gradient. When `size_average` is `True`, the loss is averaged over non-ignored
      targets. Default: -100'
    doc_dtype:
    - int
  input:
    descp: (N, C)  where C = number of classes or (N, C, H, W)  in case of 2D Loss,
      or (N, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)  where K  >= 1  in the case of K-dimensional loss.
    doc_dtype:
    - Tensor
  reduce:
    default: None
    descp: 'Deprecated (see `reduction`). By default, the losses are averaged or summed
      over observations for each minibatch depending on `size_average`. When `reduce`
      is `False`, returns a loss per batch element instead and ignores `size_average`.
      Default: `True`'
    doc_dtype:
    - bool
  reduction:
    default: mean
    descp: 'Specifies the reduction to apply to the output: `''none''` | `''mean''`
      | `''sum''`. `''none''`: no reduction will be applied, `''mean''`: the sum of
      the output will be divided by the number of elements in the output, `''sum''`:
      the output will be summed. Note: `size_average` and `reduce` are in the process
      of being deprecated, and in the meantime, specifying either of those two args
      will override `reduction`. Default: `''mean''`'
    doc_dtype:
    - string
  size_average:
    default: None
    descp: 'Deprecated (see `reduction`). By default, the losses are averaged over
      each loss element in the batch. Note that for some losses, there multiple elements
      per sample. If the field `size_average` is set to `False`, the losses are instead
      summed for each minibatch. Ignored when reduce is `False`. Default: `True`'
    doc_dtype:

  target:
    descp: (N)  where each value is 0  <= targets[i]  <= C-1 , or (N, d_1, d_2, ...,

    doc_dtype:
    - Tensor
  weight:
    default: None
    descp: a manual rescaling weight given to each class. If given, has to be a Tensor
