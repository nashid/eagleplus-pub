constraints:
  args:
    default: None
    descp: the argument tuple for the `func` invocation.
    doc_dtype:
    - tuple
  func:
    descp: a callable function, such as Python callables, builtin operators (e.g.
      `add()`) and annotated TorchScript functions.
    doc_dtype:
    - callable
  kwargs:
    default: None
    descp: is a dictionary of keyword arguments for the `func` invocation.
    doc_dtype:
    - dict
  timeout:
    default: '-1.0'
    descp: timeout in seconds for this remote call. If the creation of this `RRef`
      on worker `to` is not successfully processed on this worker within this timeout,
      then the next time there is an attempt to use the RRef (such as `to_here()`),
      a timeout will be raised indicating this failure. A value of 0 indicates an
      infinite timeout, i.e. a timeout error will never be raised. If not provided,
      the default value set during initialization or with `_set_rpc_timeout` is used.
    doc_dtype:
    - float
  to:
    descp: id or name of the destination worker.
    doc_dtype:
    - str
    - WorkerInfo
inputs:
  optional:
  - args
  - kwargs
  - timeout
  required:
  - to
  - func
