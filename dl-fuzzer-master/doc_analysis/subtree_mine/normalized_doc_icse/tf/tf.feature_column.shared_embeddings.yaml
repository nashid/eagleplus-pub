constraints:
  categorical_columns:
    descp: List of categorical columns created by a`categorical_column_with_*` function.
      These columns produce the sparse IDs that are inputs to the embedding lookup.
      All columns must be of the same type and have the same arguments except `key`.
      E.g. they can be categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file with the same vocabulary_file.
      Some or all columns could also be weighted_categorical_column.
    normalized_descp:
    - D_STRUCTURE of categorical columns created by a categorical_column_with function
    - These columns produce the sparse IDs that are inputs to the embedding lookup
    - All columns must be of the same type and have the same arguments except QSTR
    - E g
    - they can be categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file with the same vocabulary_file
    - Some or all columns could also be weighted_categorical_column
  ckpt_to_load_from:
    default: None
    descp: String representing checkpoint name/pattern from which to restore column
      weights. Required if `tensor_name_in_ckpt` is not `None`.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - D_TYPE representing checkpoint name pattern from which to restore column weights
    - Required if PARAM is not QSTR
  combiner:
    default: mean
    descp: A string specifying how to reduce if there are multiple entries in a single
      row. Currently 'mean', 'sqrtn' and 'sum' are supported, with 'mean' the default.
      'sqrtn' often achieves good accuracy, in particular with bag-of-words columns.
      Each of this can be thought as example level normalizations on the column. For
      more information, see`tf.embedding_lookup_sparse`.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE specifying how to reduce if there are multiple entries in a single
      row
    - Currently QSTR are supported with QSTR the default
    - QSTR often achieves good accuracy in particular with bag of words columns
    - Each of this can be thought as example level normalizations on the column
    - For more information see tf embedding_lookup_sparse
  dimension:
    descp: An integer specifying dimension of the embedding, must be > 0.
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE specifying dimension of the embedding must be REXPR
  initializer:
    default: None
    descp: A variable initializer function to be used in embedding variable initialization.
      If not specified, defaults to`truncated_normal_initializer` with mean `0.0`
      and standard deviation `1/sqrt(dimension)`.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A variable initializer function to be used in embedding variable initialization
    - If not specified defaults to QSTR with mean CONSTANT_FLOAT and standard deviation
      CONSTANT_NUM sqrt BSTR
  max_norm:
    default: None
    descp: If not `None`, each embedding is clipped if its l2-norm is larger than
      this value, before combining.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - If not QSTR each embedding is clipped if its l2 norm is larger than this value
      before combining
  shared_embedding_collection_name:
    default: None
    descp: Optional collective name of these columns. If not given, a reasonable name
      will be chosen based on the names of`categorical_columns`.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Optional collective name of these columns
    - If not given a reasonable name will be chosen based on the names of PARAM
  tensor_name_in_ckpt:
    default: None
    descp: Name of the `Tensor` in `ckpt_to_load_from` from which to restore the column
      weights. Required if `ckpt_to_load_from` is not `None`.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None

    - Name of the D_STRUCTURE in PARAM from which to restore the column weights
    - Required if PARAM is not QSTR
  trainable:
    default: 'True'
    descp: Whether or not the embedding is trainable. Default is True.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_descp:
    - Whether or not the embedding is trainable
    - Default is CONSTANT_BOOL
exceptions:
- ValueError: if `dimension` not > 0.
- ValueError: if any of the given `categorical_columns` is of different type or has
    different arguments than the others.
- ValueError: if exactly one of `ckpt_to_load_from` and `tensor_name_in_ckpt`is specified.
- ValueError: if `initializer` is specified and is not callable.
- RuntimeError: if eager execution is enabled.
