constraints:
  output_size:
    descp: the target output size of the form D x H x W. Can be a tuple (D, H, W)
      or a single number D for a cube D x D x D. D, H and W can be either a `int`,
      or `None` which means the size will be the same as that of the input.
inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - output_size
