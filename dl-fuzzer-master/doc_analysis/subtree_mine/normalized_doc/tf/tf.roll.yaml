    descp: 'A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. Dimension
      must be 0-D or 1-D. `axis[i]` specifies the dimension that the shift`shift[i]`

      for that axis will be the sum of all the shifts that belong to that axis.'

    - Must be one of the following types D_TYPE
    - Dimension must be CONSTANT_NUM-D or CONSTANT_NUM-D axis BSTR specifies the dimension

  shift:
    descp: 'A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. Dimension
