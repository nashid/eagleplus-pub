constraints:
  data_format:
    default: NWC
    descp: An optional string from "NWC", "NCW". Defaults to "NWC", the data is stored
      in the order of batch_shape + [in_width, in_channels]. The "NCW" format stores
      data as batch_shape + [in_channels, in_width].
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  dilations:
    default: None
    descp: An int or list of ints that has length 1 or 3 which defaults to 1. The
      dilation factor for each dimension of input. If set to k > 1, there will be
      k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that dimension. Dilations in
      the batch and depth dimensions must be 1.

  padding:
    descp: '''SAME'' or ''VALID'''
  stride:
    descp: An int or list of ints that has length 1 or 3. The number of entries by
      which the filter is moved right at each step.
