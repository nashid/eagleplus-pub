constraints:
  axis:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. 0-D. The dimension
      along which to concatenate. Must be in the range [-rank(values), rank(values)).'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  values:
    descp: A list of at least 2 Tensor objects with the same type. List of N Tensors
      to concatenate. Their ranks and types must match, and their sizes must match
      in all dimensions except concat_dim.
