sklearn.compose.make_column_transformer = make_column_transformer(*transformers, **kwargs)
    Construct a ColumnTransformer from the given transformers.
    
    This is a shorthand for the ColumnTransformer constructor; it does not
    require, and does not permit, naming the transformers. Instead, they will
    be given names automatically based on their types. It also does not allow
    weighting with ``transformer_weights``.
    
    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <make_column_transformer>`.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    *transformers : tuples
        Tuples of the form (transformer, column(s)) specifying the
        transformer objects to be applied to subsets of the data.
    
        transformer : estimator or {'passthrough', 'drop'}
            Estimator must support :term:`fit` and :term:`transform`.
            Special-cased strings 'drop' and 'passthrough' are accepted as
            well, to indicate to drop the columns or to pass them through
            untransformed, respectively.
        column(s) : string or int, array-like of string or int, slice, boolean mask array or callable
            Indexes the data on its second axis. Integers are interpreted as
            positional columns, while strings can reference DataFrame columns
            by name. A scalar string or int should be used where
            ``transformer`` expects X to be a 1d array-like (vector),
            otherwise a 2d array will be passed to the transformer.
            A callable is passed the input data `X` and can return any of the
            above.
    
    remainder : {'drop', 'passthrough'} or estimator, default 'drop'
        By default, only the specified columns in `transformers` are
        transformed and combined in the output, and the non-specified
        columns are dropped. (default of ``'drop'``).
        By specifying ``remainder='passthrough'``, all remaining columns that
        were not specified in `transformers` will be automatically passed
        through. This subset of columns is concatenated with the output of
        the transformers.
        By setting ``remainder`` to be an estimator, the remaining
        non-specified columns will use the ``remainder`` estimator. The
        estimator must support :term:`fit` and :term:`transform`.
    
    sparse_threshold : float, default = 0.3
        If the transformed output consists of a mix of sparse and dense data,
        it will be stacked as a sparse matrix if the density is lower than this
        value. Use ``sparse_threshold=0`` to always return dense.
        When the transformed output consists of all sparse or all dense data,
        the stacked result will be sparse or dense, respectively, and this
        keyword will be ignored.
    
    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Number of jobs to run in parallel.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.
    
    verbose : boolean, optional(default=False)
        If True, the time elapsed while fitting each transformer will be
        printed as it is completed.
    
    Returns
    -------
    ct : ColumnTransformer

    --------
    sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer : Class that allows combining the
        outputs of multiple transformer objects used on column subsets
        of the data into a single feature space.
