constraints:
  count:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. A scalar representing the number of times that
      input_dataset should be repeated. A value of -1 indicates that it should be
      repeated infinitely.
  input_dataset:
    descp: A Tensor of type variant.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_shapes:
    descp: A list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints) that has length
      >= 1.
  output_types:
    descp: A list of tf.DTypes that has length >= 1.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - input_dataset
  - count
  - output_types
