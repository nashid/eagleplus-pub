constraints:
  back_prop:
    default: 'True'
    descp: (optional) Deprecated. False disables support for back propagation. Prefer
      using tf.stop_gradient instead.
  elems:
    descp: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, each of which will be
      unpacked along their first dimension. The nested sequence of the resulting slices
      will be the first argument to fn.
  fn:
    descp: The callable to be performed.
  initializer:
    default: None
    descp: (optional) A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, as the initial
      value for the accumulator.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: (optional) Name prefix for the returned tensors.
  parallel_iterations:
    default: '10'
    descp: (optional) The number of iterations allowed to run in parallel.
  swap_memory:
    default: 'False'
    descp: (optional) True enables GPU-CPU memory swapping.
exceptions:
- TypeError: if fn is not callable.
inputs:
  optional:
  - initializer
  - parallel_iterations
  - back_prop
  - swap_memory
  - name
  required:
  - fn
  - elems

outputs:
- A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, resulting from applying fn consecutively
  to the list of tensors unpacked from elems, from first to last.
