constraints:
  concat_dimension:
    descp: An int. The dimension number to concatenate.
  group_assignment:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. An int32 tensor with shape [num_groups, num_replicas_per_group].
      group_assignment[i] represents the replica ids in the ith subgroup.
  input:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64, int32,
      uint8, int16, int8, complex64, int64, qint8, quint8, qint32, bfloat16, uint16,
      complex128, half, uint32, uint64, bool. The local input to the sum.'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  split_count:
    descp: An int. The number of splits, this number must equal to the sub-group size(group_assignment.get_shape()[1])
  split_dimension:
    descp: An int. The dimension number to split.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - input
  - group_assignment
  - concat_dimension
  - split_dimension
  - split_count
