constraints:
  epsilon:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as var. Ridge term. Must be a scalar.
  grad:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as var. The gradient.
  indices:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. A vector of
      indices into the first dimension of var, ms and mom.'
  lr:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as var. Scaling factor. Must be a scalar.
  mg:
    descp: A mutable Tensor. Must have the same type as var. Should be from a Variable().
  mom:
    descp: A mutable Tensor. Must have the same type as var. Should be from a Variable().
  momentum:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as var.
  ms:
    descp: A mutable Tensor. Must have the same type as var. Should be from a Variable().
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  rho:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as var. Decay rate. Must be a scalar.
  use_locking:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. If True, updating of the var, mg,
      ms, and mom tensors is protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined,
      but may exhibit less contention.
  var:
    descp: 'A mutable Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64,
      int32, uint8, int16, int8, complex64, int64, qint8, quint8, qint32, bfloat16,
      uint16, complex128, half, uint32, uint64. Should be from a Variable().'
