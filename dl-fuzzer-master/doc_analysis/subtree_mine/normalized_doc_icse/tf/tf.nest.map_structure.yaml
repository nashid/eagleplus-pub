outputs: A new structure with the same arity as `structure`, whose values correspond
  to `func(x[0], x[1], ...)` where `x[i]` is a value in the corresponding location
  in `structure[i]`. If there are different sequence types and`check_types` is `False`
  the sequence types of the first structure will be used.
