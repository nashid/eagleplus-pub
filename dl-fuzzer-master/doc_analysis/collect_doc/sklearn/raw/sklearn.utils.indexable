sklearn.utils.indexable = indexable(*iterables)
    Make arrays indexable for cross-validation.
    
    Checks consistent length, passes through None, and ensures that everything
    can be indexed by converting sparse matrices to csr and converting
    non-interable objects to arrays.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    *iterables : lists, dataframes, arrays, sparse matrices
        List of objects to ensure sliceability.
