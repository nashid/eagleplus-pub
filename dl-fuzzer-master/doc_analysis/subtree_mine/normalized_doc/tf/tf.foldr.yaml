constraints:
  back_prop:
    default: 'True'
    descp: (optional) True enables support for back propagation.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_descp:
    - BSTR CONSTANT_BOOL enables support for back propagation
  elems:
    descp: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, each of which will be
      unpacked along their first dimension.  The nested sequence of the resulting
      slices will be the first argument to `fn`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE or BSTR D_STRUCTURE of D_STRUCTURE, each of which will be unpacked
      along their first dimension
    - The nested D_STRUCTURE of the resulting slices will be the first argument to
      PARAM
  fn:
    descp: The callable to be performed.
    normalized_descp:
    - The callable to be performed
  initializer:
    default: None
    descp: (optional) A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, as the initial
      value for the accumulator.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - BSTR D_STRUCTURE of D_STRUCTURE, as the initial value for the accumulator
  name:
    default: None
    descp: (optional) Name prefix for the returned tensors.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - BSTR Name prefix for the returned D_STRUCTURE
  parallel_iterations:
    default: '10'
    descp: (optional) The number of iterations allowed to run in parallel.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_NUM
    normalized_descp:
    - BSTR The number of iterations allowed to run in parallel
  swap_memory:
    default: 'False'
    descp: (optional) True enables GPU-CPU memory swapping.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_descp:
    - BSTR CONSTANT_BOOL enables GPU CPU memory swapping
exceptions:
- TypeError: if `fn` is not callable.

outputs: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, resulting from applying`fn`
  consecutively to the list of tensors unpacked from `elems`, from last to first.
