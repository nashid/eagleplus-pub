constraints:
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  seed:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. If either seed or seed2 are set to be non-zero,
      the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, it is seeded
      by a random seed.
  seed2:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. A second seed to avoid seed collision.
  value:
    descp: A Tensor. The tensor to be shuffled.
inputs:
  optional:
  - seed
  - seed2
  - name
  required:
  - value
