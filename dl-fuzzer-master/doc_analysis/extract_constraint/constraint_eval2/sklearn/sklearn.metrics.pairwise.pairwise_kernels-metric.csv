If metric is ""precomputed"", X is assumed to be a kernel matrix. Alternatively, if metric is a callable function, it is called on each pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable should take two rows from X as input and return the corresponding kernel value as a single number. This means that callables from :mod:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise` are not allowed, as they operate on matrices, not single samples.
