constraints:
  inputs:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64. 3-D, shape:
      (max_time x batch_size x num_classes), the logits.'
  merge_repeated:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. If True, merge repeated classes in
      output.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  sequence_length:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. A vector containing sequence lengths, size (batch_size).
inputs:
  optional:
  - merge_repeated
  - name
  required:
  - inputs
  - sequence_length

outputs:
- A tuple of Tensor objects (decoded_indices, decoded_values, decoded_shape, log_probability).
- decoded_indices: A Tensor of type int64.
- decoded_values: A Tensor of type int64.
- decoded_shape: A Tensor of type int64.
- log_probability: A Tensor. Has the same type as inputs.
