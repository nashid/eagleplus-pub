constraints:
  Tout:
    descp: A list of tf.DTypes. A list of output types.
  cond:
    descp: 'A Tensor. A Tensor. If the tensor is a scalar of non-boolean type, the
      scalar is converted to a boolean according to the following rule: if the scalar
      is a numerical value, non-zero means True and zero means False; if the scalar
      is a string, non-empty means True and empty means False. If the tensor is not
      a scalar, being empty means False and being non-empty means True.'
  else_branch:
    descp: A function decorated with @Defun. A function that takes 'inputs' and returns
      a list of tensors, whose types are the same as what then_branch returns.
  input:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects. A list of input tensors.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_shapes:
    default: '[]'
    descp: An optional list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints). Defaults
      to [].
  then_branch:
    descp: A function decorated with @Defun. A function that takes 'inputs' and returns
      a list of tensors, whose types are the same as what else_branch returns.
