aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.keras.layers.dot
constraints:
  '**kwargs':
    descp: Standard layer keyword arguments.
    normalized_descp:
    - Standard layer keyword arguments
  axes:
    descp: Integer or tuple of integers, axis or axes along which to take the dot
      product.
    normalized_descp:
    - D_TYPE or D_STRUCTURE of D_TYPE, axis or axes along which to take the dot product
  inputs:
    descp: A list of input tensors (at least 2).
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE of input D_STRUCTURE BSTR
  normalize:
    default: 'False'
    descp: Whether to L2-normalize samples along the dot product axis before taking
      the dot product. If set to True, then the output of the dot product is the cosine
      proximity between the two samples.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_BOOL
