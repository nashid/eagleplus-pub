constraints:
  Tout:
    descp: A list of tf.DTypes. A list of output types.
  branch_index:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. The branch selector, an int32 Tensor.
  branches:
    descp: A list of functions decorated with @Defun that has length >= 1. A list
      of functions each of which takes 'inputs' and returns a list of tensors, whose
      types are the same as what every other branch returns.
  input:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects. A list of input tensors passed to the branch
      function.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_shapes:
    default: '[]'
    descp: An optional list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints). Defaults
      to [].
inputs:
  optional:
  - output_shapes
  - name
  required:
