- tf.compat.v1.data.experimental.scan
constraints:
  initial_state:
    descp: A nested structure of tensors, representing the initial state of the accumulator.
  scan_func:
    descp: A function that maps (old_state, input_element) to (new_state, output_element).
      It must take two arguments and return a pair of nested structures of tensors.
      The new_state must match the structure of initial_state.
