sklearn.metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score = adjusted_mutual_info_score(labels_true, labels_pred, average_method='arithmetic')
    Adjusted Mutual Information between two clusterings.
    
    Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) is an adjustment of the Mutual
    Information (MI) score to account for chance. It accounts for the fact that
    the MI is generally higher for two clusterings with a larger number of
    clusters, regardless of whether there is actually more information shared.
    For two clusterings :math:`U` and :math:`V`, the AMI is given as::
    
        AMI(U, V) = [MI(U, V) - E(MI(U, V))] / [avg(H(U), H(V)) - E(MI(U, V))]
    
    This metric is independent of the absolute values of the labels:
    a permutation of the class or cluster label values won't change the
    score value in any way.
    
    This metric is furthermore symmetric: switching ``label_true`` with
    ``label_pred`` will return the same score value. This can be useful to
    measure the agreement of two independent label assignments strategies
    on the same dataset when the real ground truth is not known.
    
    Be mindful that this function is an order of magnitude slower than other
    metrics, such as the Adjusted Rand Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels_true : int array, shape = [n_samples]
        A clustering of the data into disjoint subsets.
    
    labels_pred : int array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        A clustering of the data into disjoint subsets.
    
    average_method : string, optional (default: 'arithmetic')
        How to compute the normalizer in the denominator. Possible options
        are 'min', 'geometric', 'arithmetic', and 'max'.
    
        .. versionadded:: 0.20
    
        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
           The default value of ``average_method`` changed from 'max' to
           'arithmetic'.
    
    Returns
    -------
    ami: float (upperlimited by 1.0)
       The AMI returns a value of 1 when the two partitions are identical
       (ie perfectly matched). Random partitions (independent labellings) have
       an expected AMI around 0 on average hence can be negative.

    Examples
    --------
    
    Perfect labelings are both homogeneous and complete, hence have
    score 1.0::
    
      >>> from sklearn.metrics.cluster import adjusted_mutual_info_score
      >>> adjusted_mutual_info_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1])
      ... # doctest: +SKIP
      1.0
      >>> adjusted_mutual_info_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0])
      ... # doctest: +SKIP
      1.0
    
    If classes members are completely split across different clusters,
    the assignment is totally in-complete, hence the AMI is null::
    
      >>> adjusted_mutual_info_score([0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3])
      ... # doctest: +SKIP
      0.0
