,"{'kmeans', 'discretize'}, default: 'kmeans' The strategy to use to assign labels in the embedding space.  There are two ways to assign labels after the laplacian embedding.  k-means can be applied and is a popular choice. But it can also be sensitive to initialization. Discretization is another approach which is less sensitive to random initialization. See the 'Multiclass spectral clustering' paper referenced below for more details on the discretization approach.",kmeans,prim_dtype,dtype(string),,1
