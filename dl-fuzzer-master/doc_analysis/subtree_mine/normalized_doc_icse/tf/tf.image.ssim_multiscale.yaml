aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.image.ssim_multiscale
constraints:
  filter_sigma:
    default: '1.5'
    descp: Default value 1.5 (width of gaussian filter).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_FLOAT
    normalized_descp:
    - Default value CONSTANT_FLOAT BSTR
  filter_size:
    default: '11'
    descp: Default value 11 (size of gaussian filter).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_NUM
    normalized_descp:
    - Default value CONSTANT_NUM BSTR
  img1:
    descp: First image batch.
    normalized_descp:
    - First image batch
  img2:
    descp: Second image batch. Must have the same rank as img1.
    normalized_descp:
    - Second image batch
    - Must have the same rank as PARAM
  k1:
    default: '0.01'
    descp: Default value 0.01
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_FLOAT
    normalized_descp:
    - Default value CONSTANT_FLOAT
  k2:
    default: '0.03'
    descp: Default value 0.03 (SSIM is less sensitivity to K2 for lower values, so
      it would be better if we taken the values in range of 0< K2 <0.4).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_FLOAT
    normalized_descp:
    - Default value CONSTANT_FLOAT SSIM is less sensitivity to K2 for lower values
      so it would be better if we taken the values in range of CONSTANT_NUM REXPR
      REXPR
  max_val:
    descp: The dynamic range of the images (i.e., the difference between the maximum
      the and minimum allowed values).
    normalized_descp:
    - The dynamic range of the images BSTR
  power_factors:
    default: _MSSSIM_WEIGHTS
    descp: Iterable of weights for each of the scales. The number of scales used is
      the length of the list. Index 0 is the unscaled resolution's weight and each
      increasing scale corresponds to the image being downsampled by 2.  Defaults
      to (0.0448, 0.2856, 0.3001, 0.2363, 0.1333), which are the values obtained in
      the original paper.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - D_STRUCTURE of weights for each of the scales
    - The number of scales used is the length of the D_STRUCTURE
    - Index CONSTANT_NUM is the unscaled resolution weight and each increasing scale
      corresponds to the image being downsampled by CONSTANT_NUM
    - Defaults to BSTR which are the values obtained in the original paper
