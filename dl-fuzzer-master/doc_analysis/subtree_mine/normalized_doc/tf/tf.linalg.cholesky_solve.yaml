constraints:
  chol:
    descp: A `Tensor`.  Must be `float32` or `float64`, shape is `[..., M, M]`. Cholesky
      factorization of `A`, e.g. `chol = tf.linalg.cholesky(A)`. For that reason,
      only the lower triangular parts (including the diagonal) of the last two dimensions
      of `chol` are used.  The strictly upper part is assumed to be zero and not accessed.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE
    - Must be D_TYPE, shape is BSTR
    - Cholesky factorization of QSTR , e g
    - chol tf linalg cholesky BSTR
    - For that reason, only the lower triangular parts BSTR of the last two dimensions
      of QSTR are used
    - The strictly upper part is assumed to be zero and not accessed
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name to give this `Op`.  Defaults to `cholesky_solve`.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A name to give this QSTR
    - Defaults to QSTR
  rhs:
    descp: A `Tensor`, same type as `chol`, shape is `[..., M, K]`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE, same type as PARAM, shape is BSTR
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - chol
