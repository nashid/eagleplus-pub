  rate:
    descp: float, drop probability (as with `Dropout`). The multiplicative noise will
      have standard deviation `sqrt(rate / (1 - rate))`.
    normalized_descp:
    - D_TYPE drop probability as with QSTR
    - The multiplicative noise will have standard deviation sqrt BSTR
  seed:
    default: None
    descp: A Python integer to use as random seed.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A Python D_TYPE to use as random seed
inputs:
  optional:
  - noise_shape
  - seed
  - '**kwargs'
