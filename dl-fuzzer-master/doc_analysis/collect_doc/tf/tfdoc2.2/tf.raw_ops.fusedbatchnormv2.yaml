constraints:
  data_format:
    default: NHWC
    descp: 'An optional string from: "NHWC", "NCHW". Defaults to "NHWC". The data
      format for x and y. Either "NHWC" (default) or "NCHW".'
  epsilon:
    default: '0.0001'
    descp: An optional float. Defaults to 0.0001. A small float number added to the
      variance of x.
  exponential_avg_factor:
    default: '1'
    descp: An optional float. Defaults to 1.
  is_training:
    default: 'True'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to True. A bool value to indicate the operation
      is for training (default) or inference.
  mean:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as scale. A 1D Tensor for population
      mean. Used for inference only; must be empty for training.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  offset:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as scale. A 1D Tensor for offset, to
      shift to the normalized x.
  scale:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32. A 1D Tensor for
      scaling factor, to scale the normalized x.'
  variance:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as scale. A 1D Tensor for population
      variance. Used for inference only; must be empty for training.
  x:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, bfloat16, float32.
      A 4D Tensor for input data.'
