,"Optional, either a `tf.function` with an input signature specified or the result of `f.get_concrete_function` on a`@tf.function`-decorated function `f`, in which case `f` will be used to generate a signature for the SavedModel under the default serving signature key. `signatures` may also be a dictionary, in which case it maps from signature keys to either `tf.function` instances with input signatures or concrete functions. The keys of such a dictionary may be arbitrary strings, but will typically be from the`tf.saved_model.signature_constants` module.",None,,,0,0
