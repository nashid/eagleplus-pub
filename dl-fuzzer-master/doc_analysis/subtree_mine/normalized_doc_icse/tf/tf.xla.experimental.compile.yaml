constraints:
  computation:
    descp: A Python function that builds a computation to apply to the input. If the
      function takes n inputs, 'inputs' should be a list of n tensors.`computation`
      may return a list of operations and tensors.  Tensors must come before operations
      in the returned list.  The return value of`compile` is a list of tensors corresponding
      to the tensors from the output of `computation`.All `Operation`s returned from
      `computation` will be executed when evaluating any of the returned output tensors.
    normalized_descp:
    - A Python function that builds a computation to apply to the input
    - If the function takes n PARAM PARAM should be a D_STRUCTURE of n D_STRUCTURE
      QSTR may return a D_STRUCTURE of operations and D_STRUCTURE
    - D_STRUCTURE must come before operations in the returned D_STRUCTURE
    - The return value of QSTR is a D_STRUCTURE of D_STRUCTURE corresponding to the
      D_STRUCTURE from the output of QSTR All QSTR returned from QSTR will be executed
      when evaluating any of the returned output D_STRUCTURE
  inputs:
    default: None
    descp: A list of inputs or `None` (equivalent to an empty list). Each input can
      be a nested structure containing values that are convertible to tensors. Note
      that passing an N-dimension list of compatible values will result in a N-dimension
      list of scalar tensors rather than a single Rank-N tensors. If you need different
      behavior, convert part of inputs to tensors with `tf.convert_to_tensor`.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE of inputs or QSTR BSTR
    - Each input can be a nested structure containing values that are convertible
      to D_STRUCTURE
    - Note that passing an N dimension D_STRUCTURE of compatible values will result
      in a N dimension D_STRUCTURE of scalar D_STRUCTURE rather than a single Rank
      N D_STRUCTURE
    - If you need different behavior convert part of inputs to D_STRUCTURE with tf
      convert_to_tensor

outputs: 'Same data structure as if computation(*inputs) is called directly with some
  exceptions for correctness. Exceptions include:   1) None output: a NoOp would be
  returned which control-depends on      computation.   2) Single value output: A
  tuple containing the value would be returned.   3) Operation-only outputs: a NoOp
  would be returned which      control-depends on computation.'
