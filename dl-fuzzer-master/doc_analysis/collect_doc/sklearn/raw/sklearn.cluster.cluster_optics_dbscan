sklearn.cluster.cluster_optics_dbscan = cluster_optics_dbscan(reachability, core_distances, ordering, eps)
    Performs DBSCAN extraction for an arbitrary epsilon.
    
    Extracting the clusters runs in linear time. Note that this results in
    ``labels_`` which are close to a :class:`~sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN` with
    similar settings and ``eps``, only if ``eps`` is close to ``max_eps``.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    reachability : array, shape (n_samples,)
        Reachability distances calculated by OPTICS (``reachability_``)
    
    core_distances : array, shape (n_samples,)
        Distances at which points become core (``core_distances_``)
    
    ordering : array, shape (n_samples,)
        OPTICS ordered point indices (``ordering_``)
    
    eps : float
        DBSCAN ``eps`` parameter. Must be set to < ``max_eps``. Results
        will be close to DBSCAN algorithm if ``eps`` and ``max_eps`` are close
        to one another.
    
    Returns
    -------
    labels_ : array, shape (n_samples,)
        The estimated labels.
