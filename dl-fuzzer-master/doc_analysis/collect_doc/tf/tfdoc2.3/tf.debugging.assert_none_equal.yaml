  message:
    default: None
    descp: A string to prefix to the default message.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for this operation (optional). Defaults to "assert_none_equal".
  summarize:
    default: None
    descp: Print this many entries of each tensor.
  x:
    descp: Numeric Tensor.
  y:
    descp: Numeric Tensor, same dtype as and broadcastable to x.
exceptions:
- InvalidArgumentError: if the check can be performed immediately and x != y is False
    for any pair of elements in x and y. The check can be performed immediately during
    eager execution or if x and y are statically known.
inputs:
  optional:
  - summarize
  - message
  - name
  required:
  - x
  - y

outputs:
- Op that raises InvalidArgumentError if x != y is ever False. This can be used with
  tf.control_dependencies inside of tf.functions to block followup computation until
  the check has executed.
