constraints:
  images:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: bfloat16, half, float32,
      float64, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, complex64,
      complex128, bool. 4-D Tensor with shape [batch, in_rows, in_cols, depth].'
  ksizes:
    descp: A list of ints that has length >= 4. The size of the sliding window for
      each dimension of images.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  padding:
    descp: 'A string from: "SAME", "VALID". The type of padding algorithm to use.'
  rates:
    descp: 'A list of ints that has length >= 4. Must be: [1, rate_rows, rate_cols,
      1]. This is the input stride, specifying how far two consecutive patch samples
      are in the input. Equivalent to extracting patches with patch_sizes_eff = patch_sizes
      + (patch_sizes - 1) * (rates - 1), followed by subsampling them spatially by
      a factor of rates. This is equivalent to rate in dilated (a.k.a. Atrous) convolutions.'
  strides:
    descp: 'A list of ints that has length >= 4. How far the centers of two consecutive
      patches are in the images. Must be: [1, stride_rows, stride_cols, 1].'
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - images
  - ksizes
  - strides
  - rates
  - padding
