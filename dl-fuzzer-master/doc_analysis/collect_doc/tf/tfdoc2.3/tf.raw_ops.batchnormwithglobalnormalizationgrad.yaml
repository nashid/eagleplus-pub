constraints:
  backprop:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as t. 4D backprop Tensor.
  gamma:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as t. A 1D gamma Tensor with size matching
      the last dimension of t. If "scale_after_normalization" is true, this Tensor
      will be multiplied with the normalized Tensor.
  m:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as t. A 1D mean Tensor with size matching
      the last dimension of t. This is the first output from tf.nn.moments, or a saved
      moving average thereof.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  scale_after_normalization:
    descp: A bool. A bool indicating whether the resulted tensor needs to be multiplied
      with gamma.
  t:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64, int32,
      uint8, int16, int8, complex64, int64, qint8, quint8, qint32, bfloat16, uint16,
      complex128, half, uint32, uint64. A 4D input Tensor.'
  v:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as t. A 1D variance Tensor with size
      matching the last dimension of t. This is the second output from tf.nn.moments,
      or a saved moving average thereof.
  variance_epsilon:
    descp: A float. A small float number to avoid dividing by 0.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - t
  - m
  - v
  - gamma
  - backprop
  - variance_epsilon
  - scale_after_normalization
