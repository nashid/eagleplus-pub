constraints:
  col_pooling_sequence:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. column pooling sequence, form pooling region with
      row_pooling sequence.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  orig_input_tensor_shape:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. Original input tensor shape for fractional_avg_pool
  out_backprop:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64, int32,
      int64. 4-D with shape [batch, height, width, channels]. Gradients w.r.t. the
      output of fractional_avg_pool.'
  overlapping:
    default: 'False'
    descp: 'An optional bool. Defaults to False. When set to True, it means when pooling,
      the values at the boundary of adjacent pooling cells are used by both cells.
      For example: index 0 1 2 3 4 value 20 5 16 3 7 If the pooling sequence is [0,
      2, 4], then 16, at index 2 will be used twice. The result would be [41/3, 26/3]
      for fractional avg pooling.'
  row_pooling_sequence:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. row pooling sequence, form pooling region with
      col_pooling_sequence.
