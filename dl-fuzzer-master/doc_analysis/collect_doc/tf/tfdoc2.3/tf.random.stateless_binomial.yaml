aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.random.stateless_binomial
constraints:
  counts:
    descp: Tensor. The counts of the binomial distribution. Must be broadcastable
      with probs, and broadcastable with the rightmost dimensions of shape.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_dtype:
    default: tf.dtypes.int32
    descp: 'The type of the output. Default: tf.int32'
  probs:
    descp: Tensor. The probability of success for the binomial distribution. Must
      be broadcastable with counts and broadcastable with the rightmost dimensions
      of shape.
  seed:
    descp: A shape [2] Tensor, the seed to the random number generator. Must have
      dtype int32 or int64. (When using XLA, only int32 is allowed.)
  shape:
    descp: A 1-D integer Tensor or Python array. The shape of the output tensor.
inputs:
  optional:
  - output_dtype
  - name
  required:
  - shape
  - seed
  - counts
  - probs

outputs:
- samples: A Tensor of the specified shape filled with random binomial values. For
    each i, each samples[..., i] is an independent draw from the binomial distribution
    on counts[i] trials with probability of success probs[i].
