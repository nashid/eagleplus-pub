constraints:
  features:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as gradients. The features passed as
      input to the corresponding Relu operation, OR the outputs of that operation
      (both work equivalently).
  gradients:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64, int32,
      uint8, int16, int8, int64, bfloat16, uint16, half, uint32, uint64. The backpropagated
      gradients to the corresponding Relu operation.'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - gradients
  - features
