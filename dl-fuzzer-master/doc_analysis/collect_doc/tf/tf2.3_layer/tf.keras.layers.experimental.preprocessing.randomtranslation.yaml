constraints:
  '**kwargs':
    descp: ''
  fill_mode:
    default: reflect
    descp: 'Points outside the boundaries of the input are filled according to the
      given mode (one of {''constant'', ''reflect'', ''wrap''}). reflect: (d c b a
      | a b c d | d c b a) The input is extended by reflecting about the edge of the
      last pixel. constant: (k k k k | a b c d | k k k k) The input is extended by
      filling all values beyond the edge with the same constant value k = 0. wrap:
      (a b c d | a b c d | a b c d) The input is extended by wrapping around to the
      opposite edge.'
  height_factor:
    descp: a float represented as fraction of value, or a tuple of size 2 representing
      lower and upper bound for shifting vertically. A negative value means shifting
      image up, while a positive value means shifting image down. When represented
      as a single positive float, this value is used for both the upper and lower
      bound. For instance, height_factor=(-0.2, 0.3) results in an output shifted
      by a random amount in the range [-20%, +30%]. height_factor=0.2 results in an
      output height shifted by a random amount in the range [-20%, +20%].
  interpolation:
    default: bilinear
    descp: 'Interpolation mode. Supported values: "nearest", "bilinear".'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A string, the name of the layer.
  seed:
    default: None
    descp: Integer. Used to create a random seed.
  width_factor:
    descp: a float represented as fraction of value, or a tuple of size 2 representing
      lower and upper bound for shifting horizontally. A negative value means shifting
      image left, while a positive value means shifting image right. When represented
      as a single positive float, this value is used for both the upper and lower
      bound. For instance, width_factor=(-0.2, 0.3) results in an output shifted left
      by 20%, and shifted right by 30%. width_factor=0.2 results in an output height
      shifted left or right by 20%.
