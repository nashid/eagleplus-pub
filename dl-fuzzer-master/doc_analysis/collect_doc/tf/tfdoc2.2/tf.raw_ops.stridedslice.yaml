constraints:
  begin:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. begin[k] specifies
      the offset into the kth range specification. The exact dimension this corresponds
      to will be determined by context. Out-of-bounds values will be silently clamped.
      If the kth bit of begin_mask then begin[k] is ignored and the full range of
      the appropriate dimension is used instead. Negative values causes indexing to
      start from the highest element e.g. If foo==[1,2,3] then foo[-1]==3.'
  begin_mask:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. a bitmask where a bit i being 1 means to
      ignore the begin value and instead use the largest interval possible. At runtime
      begin[i] will be replaced with [0, n-1) if stride[i] > 0 or [-1, n-1] if stride[i]
      < 0
  ellipsis_mask:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. a bitmask where bit i being 1 means the
      ith position is actually an ellipsis. One bit at most can be 1. If ellipsis_mask
      == 0, then an implicit ellipsis mask of 1 << (m+1) is provided. This means that
      foo[3:5] == foo[3:5, ...]. An ellipsis implicitly creates as many range specifications
      as necessary to fully specify the sliced range for every dimension. For example
      for a 4-dimensional tensor foo the slice foo[2, ..., 5:8] implies foo[2, :,
      :, 5:8].
  end:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as begin. end[i] is like begin with the
      exception that end_mask is used to determine full ranges.
  end_mask:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. analogous to begin_mask
  input:
    descp: A Tensor.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  new_axis_mask:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. a bitmask where bit i being 1 means the
      ith specification creates a new shape 1 dimension. For example foo[:4, tf.newaxis,
      :2] would produce a shape (4, 1, 2) tensor.
  shrink_axis_mask:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. a bitmask where bit i implies that the
      ith specification should shrink the dimensionality. begin and end must imply
      a slice of size 1 in the dimension. For example in python one might do foo[:,
      3, :] which would result in shrink_axis_mask being 2.
  strides:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as begin. strides[i] specifies the increment
      in the ith specification after extracting a given element. Negative indices
      will reverse the original order. Out or range values are clamped to [0,dim[i])
      if slice[i]>0 or [-1,dim[i]-1] if slice[i] < 0
