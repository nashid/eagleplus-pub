constraints:
  finalize_func:
    descp: A function decorated with @Defun. A function mapping the final reducer
      state to an output element.
  finalize_func_other_arguments:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects. A list of tensors, typically values that were
      captured when building a closure for finalize_func.
  init_func:
    descp: A function decorated with @Defun. A function mapping a key of type DT_INT64,
      concatenated with init_func_other_arguments to the initial reducer state.
  init_func_other_arguments:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects. A list of tensors, typically values that were
      captured when building a closure for init_func.
  input_dataset:
    descp: A Tensor of type variant. A variant tensor representing the input dataset.
  key_func:
    descp: A function decorated with @Defun. A function mapping an element of input_dataset,
      concatenated with key_func_other_arguments to a scalar value of type DT_INT64.
  key_func_other_arguments:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects. A list of tensors, typically values that were
      captured when building a closure for key_func.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_shapes:
    descp: A list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints) that has length
      >= 1.
  output_types:
    descp: A list of tf.DTypes that has length >= 1.
  reduce_func:
    descp: A function decorated with @Defun. A function mapping the current reducer
      state and an element of input_dataset, concatenated with reduce_func_other_arguments
      to a new reducer state.
  reduce_func_other_arguments:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects. A list of tensors, typically values that were
      captured when building a closure for reduce_func.
