constraints:
  min_cluster_size:
    default: None
    descp: int > 1 or float between 0 and 1 (default=None) Minimum number of samples
      in an OPTICS cluster, expressed as an absolute number or a fraction of the number
      of samples (rounded to be at least 2). If ``None``, the value of ``min_samples``
      is used instead.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
    range:
    - '[0,inf)'
  min_samples:
    descp: int > 1 or float between 0 and 1 The same as the min_samples given to OPTICS.
      Up and down steep regions can't have more then ``min_samples`` consecutive non-steep
      points. Expressed as an absolute number or a fraction of the number of samples
      (rounded to be at least 2).

    - int
    ndim:

    range:

  ordering:
    descp: array, shape (n_samples,) OPTICS ordered point indices (`ordering_`)
    ndim:
    - '1'
    shape:
    - '[n_samples]'
  predecessor:
    descp: array, shape (n_samples,) Predecessors calculated by OPTICS.
    ndim:
    - '1'
    shape:
    - '[n_samples]'
  predecessor_correction:
    default: 'True'
    descp: bool, optional (default=True) Correct clusters based on the calculated
      predecessors.
    dtype:
    - boolean
    ndim:
    - '0'
  reachability:
    descp: array, shape (n_samples,) Reachability distances calculated by OPTICS (`reachability_`)
    ndim:
    - '1'
    shape:
    - '[n_samples]'
  xi:
    default: '0.05'
    descp: float, between 0 and 1, optional (default=0.05) Determines the minimum
      steepness on the reachability plot that constitutes a cluster boundary. For
      example, an upwards point in the reachability plot is defined by the ratio from
      one point to its successor being at most 1-xi.
