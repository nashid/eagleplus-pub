constraints:
  dtype:
    default: <class numpy.float64>
    descp: numpy data type, default np.float64 Data type of dataset to be loaded.
      This will be the data type of the output numpy arrays ``X`` and ``y``.
    dtype:
    - numpy.dtype
  f:
    descp: '{str, file-like, int} (Path to) a file to load. If a path ends in ".gz"
      or ".bz2", it will be uncompressed on the fly. If an integer is passed, it is
      assumed to be a file descriptor. A file-like or file descriptor will not be
      closed by this function. A file-like object must be opened in binary mode.'
  length:
    default: '-1'
    descp: integer, optional, default -1 If strictly positive, stop reading any new
      line of data once the position in the file has reached the (offset + length)
      bytes threshold.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
    range:
    - '[0,inf)'
  multilabel:
    default: 'False'
    descp: boolean, optional, default False Samples may have several labels each (see
      https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multilabel.html)
    dtype:
    - boolean
    ndim:
    - '0'
  n_features:
    default: None
    descp: 'int or None The number of features to use. If None, it will be inferred.
      This argument is useful to load several files that are subsets of a bigger sliced
      dataset: each subset might not have examples of every feature, hence the inferred
      shape might vary from one slice to another. n_features is only required if ``offset``
      or ``length`` are passed a non-default value.'
    dtype:
    - int
  offset:
    default: '0'
    descp: integer, optional, default 0 Ignore the offset first bytes by seeking forward,
      then discarding the following bytes up until the next new line character.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
  query_id:
    default: 'False'
    descp: boolean, default False If True, will return the query_id array for each
      file.
    dtype:
    - boolean
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
    range:
    - '[0,inf)'
  zero_based:
    default: auto
    descp: boolean or "auto", optional, default "auto" Whether column indices in f
      are zero-based (True) or one-based (False). If column indices are one-based,
      they are transformed to zero-based to match Python/NumPy conventions. If set
      to "auto", a heuristic check is applied to determine this from the file contents.
      Both kinds of files occur "in the wild", but they are unfortunately not self-identifying.
      Using "auto" or True should always be safe when no ``offset`` or ``length``
      is passed. If ``offset`` or ``length`` are passed, the "auto" mode falls back
      to ``zero_based=True`` to avoid having the heuristic check yield inconsistent
      results on different segments of the file.
