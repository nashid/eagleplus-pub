constraints:
  dtype:
    default: <class numpy.float64>
    descp: numpy data type, default np.float64 Data type of dataset to be loaded.
      This will be the data type of the output numpy arrays ``X`` and ``y``.
    dtype:
    - numpy.float64
  files:
    descp: iterable over {str, file-like, int} (Paths of) files to load. If a path
      ends in ".gz" or ".bz2", it will be uncompressed on the fly. If an integer is
      passed, it is assumed to be a file descriptor. File-likes and file descriptors
      will not be closed by this function. File-like objects must be opened in binary
      mode.
    dtype:
    - boolean
    - int
    - string
    ndim:
    - '0'
    structure:
    - list
  length:
    default: '-1'
    descp: integer, optional, default -1 If strictly positive, stop reading any new
      line of data once the position in the file has reached the (offset + length)
      bytes threshold.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
  multilabel:
    default: 'False'
    descp: boolean, optional Samples may have several labels each (see https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multilabel.html)
    dtype:
    - boolean
    ndim:
    - '0'
  n_features:
    default: None
    descp: int or None The number of features to use. If None, it will be inferred
      from the maximum column index occurring in any of the files. This can be set
      to a higher value than the actual number of features in any of the input files,
      but setting it to a lower value will cause an exception to be raised.
    dtype:
    - boolean
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
    range:
    - '[0,inf)'
  offset:
    default: '0'
    descp: integer, optional, default 0 Ignore the offset first bytes by seeking forward,
      then discarding the following bytes up until the next new line character.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
  query_id:
    default: 'False'
    descp: boolean, defaults to False If True, will return the query_id array for
      each file.
    dtype:
    - boolean
    ndim:
    - '0'
    structure:
    - ndarray
  zero_based:
    default: auto
    descp: boolean or "auto", optional Whether column indices in f are zero-based
      (True) or one-based (False). If column indices are one-based, they are transformed
      to zero-based to match Python/NumPy conventions. If set to "auto", a heuristic
      check is applied to determine this from the file contents. Both kinds of files
      occur "in the wild", but they are unfortunately not self-identifying. Using
      "auto" or True should always be safe when no offset or length is passed. If
      offset or length are passed, the "auto" mode falls back to zero_based=True to
      avoid having the heuristic check yield inconsistent results on different segments
      of the file.
