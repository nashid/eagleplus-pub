constraints:
  inputs:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. The input to be joined. All reduced indices must
      have non-zero size.
  keep_dims:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. If True, retain reduced dimensions
      with length 1.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  reduction_indices:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. The dimensions to reduce over. Dimensions are reduced
      in the order specified. Omitting reduction_indices is equivalent to passing
      [n-1, n-2, ..., 0]. Negative indices from -n to -1 are supported.
  separator:
    default: ''
    descp: An optional string. Defaults to "". The separator to use when joining.
inputs:
  optional:
  - keep_dims
  - separator
  - name
  required:
  - inputs
  - reduction_indices
