constraints:
  data_format:
    default: NHWC
    descp: A string. 'NHWC' and 'NCHW' are supported.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE
    - QSTR are supported
  dilations:
    default: None
    descp: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `2` or `4`, defaults to 1.
      The dilation factor for each dimension of`input`. If a single value is given
      it is replicated in the `H` and `W` dimension. By default the `N` and `C` dimensions
      are set to 1. If set to k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between each
      filter element on that dimension. The dimension order is determined by the value
      of `data_format`, see above for details. Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions
      if a 4-d tensor must be 1.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE or D_STRUCTURE of D_TYPE that has length CONSTANT_NUM, defaults to
      CONSTANT_NUM
    - The dilation factor for each dimension of PARAM
    - If a single value is given it is replicated in the QSTR dimension
    - By default the QSTR dimensions are set to CONSTANT_NUM
    - If set to k REXPR, there will be k CONSTANT_NUM skipped cells between each filter
      element on that dimension
    - The dimension order is determined by the value of PARAM, see above for details
    - Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions if a CONSTANT_NUM-D D_STRUCTURE
      must be CONSTANT_NUM
  filters:
    descp: A 4-D `Tensor` with the same type as `input` and shape `[height, width,
      output_channels, in_channels]`.  `filter`'s `in_channels` dimension must match
      that of `input`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM-D D_STRUCTURE with the same type as PARAM and shape BSTR
    - QSTR dimension must match that of PARAM
  input:
    descp: A 4-D `Tensor` of type `float` and shape `[batch, height, width, in_channels]`
      for `NHWC` data format or `[batch, in_channels, height, width]` for `NCHW` data
      format.
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM-D D_STRUCTURE of type D_TYPE and shape BSTR for QSTR data format
      or BSTR for QSTR data format
  name:
    default: None
    descp: Optional name for the returned tensor.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Optional name for the returned D_STRUCTURE
  output_shape:
    descp: A 1-D `Tensor` representing the output shape of the deconvolution op.
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM-D D_STRUCTURE representing the output shape of the deconvolution
      op
  padding:
    default: SAME
    descp: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm. See the
      "returns" section of `tf.nn.convolution` for details.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE, either QSTR
    - The padding algorithm
    - See the QSTR section of tf nn convolution for details
  strides:
    descp: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `2` or `4`.  The stride of
      the sliding window for each dimension of `input`. If a single value is given
      it is replicated in the `H` and `W` dimension. By default the `N` and `C` dimensions
      are set to 0. The dimension order is determined by the value of `data_format`,
      see below for details.
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE or D_STRUCTURE of D_TYPE that has length CONSTANT_NUM
    - The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of PARAM
    - If a single value is given it is replicated in the QSTR dimension
    - By default the QSTR dimensions are set to CONSTANT_NUM
    - The dimension order is determined by the value of PARAM, see below for details
exceptions:
- ValueError: If input/output depth does not match `filter`'s shape, or if padding
    is other than `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`.
