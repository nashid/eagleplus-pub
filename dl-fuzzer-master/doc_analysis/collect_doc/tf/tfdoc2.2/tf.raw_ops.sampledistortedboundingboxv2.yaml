constraints:
  area_range:
    default: '[0.05, 1]'
    descp: An optional list of floats. Defaults to [0.05, 1]. The cropped area of
      the image must contain a fraction of the supplied image within this range.
  aspect_ratio_range:
    default: '[0.75, 1.33]'
    descp: An optional list of floats. Defaults to [0.75, 1.33]. The cropped area
      of the image must have an aspect ratio = width / height within this range.
  bounding_boxes:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. 3-D with shape [batch, N, 4] describing the N
      bounding boxes associated with the image.
  image_size:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: uint8, int8, int16, int32,
      int64. 1-D, containing [height, width, channels].'
  max_attempts:
    default: '100'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 100. Number of attempts at generating a cropped
      region of the image of the specified constraints. After max_attempts failures,
      return the entire image.
  min_object_covered:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. The cropped area of the image must contain at
      least this fraction of any bounding box supplied. The value of this parameter
      should be non-negative. In the case of 0, the cropped area does not need to
      overlap any of the bounding boxes supplied.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  seed:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. If either seed or seed2 are set to non-zero,
      the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, it is seeded
      by a random seed.
  seed2:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. A second seed to avoid seed collision.
  use_image_if_no_bounding_boxes:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. Controls behavior if no bounding boxes
      supplied. If true, assume an implicit bounding box covering the whole input.
      If false, raise an error.

  - seed
