constraints:
  images:
    descp: A 4-D Tensor with shape `[batch, in_rows, in_cols, depth]
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM D D_STRUCTURE with shape BSTR
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for the operation BSTR
  padding:
    descp: The type of padding algorithm to use.
    normalized_descp:
    - The type of padding algorithm to use
  rates:
    descp: 'A 1-D Tensor of length 4. Must be: `[1, rate_rows, rate_cols, 1]`. This
      is the input stride, specifying how far two consecutive patch samples are in
      the input. Equivalent to extracting patches with `patch_sizes_eff = patch_sizes
      + (patch_sizes - 1) * (rates - 1)`, followed by subsampling them spatially by
      a factor of `rates`. This is equivalent to `rate` in dilated (a.k.a. Atrous)
      convolutions.'
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM D D_STRUCTURE of length CONSTANT_NUM
    - Must be BSTR
    - This is the input stride specifying how far two consecutive patch samples are
      in the input
    - Equivalent to extracting patches with patch_sizes_eff patch_sizes BSTR followed
      by subsampling them spatially by a factor of QSTR
    - This is equivalent to QSTR in dilated a k a
    - Atrous convolutions
  sizes:
    descp: The size of the extracted patches. Must be [1, size_rows, size_cols, 1].
    normalized_descp:
    - The size of the extracted patches
    - Must be BSTR
  strides:
    descp: 'A 1-D Tensor of length 4. How far the centers of two consecutive patches
      are in the images. Must be: `[1, stride_rows, stride_cols, 1]`.'
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM D D_STRUCTURE of length CONSTANT_NUM
    - How far the centers of two consecutive patches are in the PARAM
    - Must be BSTR
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - images
  - sizes
  - strides
  - rates
  - padding
