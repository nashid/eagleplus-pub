constraints:
  axis:
    default: None
    descp: Which axis to join along. The default behavior is to join all elements,
      producing a scalar.
  inputs:
    descp: A tf.string tensor.
  keepdims:
    default: 'False'
    descp: If true, retains reduced dimensions with length 1.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  separator:
    default: ''
    descp: a string added between each string being joined.
inputs:
  optional:
  - axis
  - keepdims
  - separator
  - name
  required:
  - inputs
