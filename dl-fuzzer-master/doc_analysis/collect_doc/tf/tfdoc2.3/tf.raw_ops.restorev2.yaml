constraints:
  dtypes:
    descp: A list of tf.DTypes that has length >= 1. shape {N}. The list of expected
      dtype for the tensors. Must match those stored in the checkpoint.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  prefix:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. Must have a single element. The prefix of a V2
      checkpoint.
  shape_and_slices:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. shape {N}. The slice specs of the tensors to be
      restored. Empty strings indicate that they are non-partitioned tensors.
  tensor_names:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. shape {N}. The names of the tensors to be restored.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - prefix
  - tensor_names
  - shape_and_slices
  - dtypes
