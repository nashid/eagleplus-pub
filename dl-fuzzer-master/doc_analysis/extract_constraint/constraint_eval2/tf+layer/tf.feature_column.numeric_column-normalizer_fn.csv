,"If not `None`, a function that can be used to normalize the value of the tensor after `default_value` is applied for parsing. Normalizer function takes the input `Tensor` as its argument, and returns the output `Tensor`. (e.g. lambda x: (x - 3.0) / 4.2). Please note that even though the most common use case of this function is normalization, it can be used for any kind of Tensorflow transformations.",None,,,0,0
