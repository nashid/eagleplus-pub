constraints:
  axis:
    descp: 0-D `int32` `Tensor`.  Dimension along which to concatenate. Must be in
      the range `[-rank(values), rank(values))`. As in Python, indexing for axis is
      0-based. Positive axis in the rage of `[0, rank(values))` refers to `axis`-th
      dimension. And negative axis refers to `axis + rank(values)`-th dimension.
