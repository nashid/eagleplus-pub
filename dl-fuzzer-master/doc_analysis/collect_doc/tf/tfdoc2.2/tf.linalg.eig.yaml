- tf.eig
constraints:
  name:
    default: None
    descp: string, optional name of the operation.
  tensor:
    descp: Tensor of shape [..., N, N]. Only the lower triangular part of each inner
      inner matrix is referenced.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - tensor

outputs:
- e: Eigenvalues. Shape is [..., N]. Sorted in non-decreasing order.
- v: Eigenvectors. Shape is [..., N, N]. The columns of the inner most matrices contain
    eigenvectors of the corresponding matrices in tensor
