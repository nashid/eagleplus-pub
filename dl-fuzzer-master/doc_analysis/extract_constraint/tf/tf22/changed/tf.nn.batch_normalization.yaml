constraints:
  mean:
    descp: A mean Tensor.
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for this operation (optional).
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  offset:
    descp: An offset Tensor, often denoted \(\beta\) in equations, or None. If present,
      will be added to the normalized tensor.
