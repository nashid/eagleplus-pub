aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.random.stateless_parameterized_truncated_normal
constraints:
  maxvals:
    default: '2.0'
    descp: A Tensor or Python value of type dtype. The maximum value of the truncated
      normal distribution. This must broadcast with means, stddevs and minvals, and
      the broadcasted shape must be dominated by shape.
  means:
    default: '0.0'
    descp: A Tensor or Python value of type dtype. The mean of the truncated normal
      distribution. This must broadcast with stddevs, minvals and maxvals, and the
      broadcasted shape must be dominated by shape.
  minvals:
    default: '-2.0'
    descp: A Tensor or Python value of type dtype. The minimum value of the truncated
      normal distribution. This must broadcast with means, stddevs and maxvals, and
      the broadcasted shape must be dominated by shape.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  seed:
    descp: A shape [2] Tensor, the seed to the random number generator. Must have
      dtype int32 or int64. (When using XLA, only int32 is allowed.)
  shape:
    descp: A 1-D integer Tensor or Python array. The shape of the output tensor.
  stddevs:
    default: '1.0'
    descp: A Tensor or Python value of type dtype. The standard deviation of the truncated
      normal distribution. This must broadcast with means, minvals and maxvals, and
      the broadcasted shape must be dominated by shape.
inputs:
  optional:
  - means
  - stddevs
