"int, optional, default=1","Interpolation method (default=cv2.INTER_LINEAR). Possible values: 0: Nearest Neighbors Interpolation. 1: Bilinear interpolation. 2: Bicubic interpolation over 4x4 pixel neighborhood. 3: Area-based (resampling using pixel area relation). It may be a preferred method for image decimation, as it gives moire-free results. But when the image is zoomed, it is similar to the Nearest Neighbors method. (used by default). 4: Lanczos interpolation over 8x8 pixel neighborhood. 9: Cubic for enlarge, area for shrink, bilinear for others 10: Random select from interpolation method metioned above. Note: When shrinking an image, it will generally look best with AREA-based interpolation, whereas, when enlarging an image, it will generally look best with Bicubic (slow) or Bilinear (faster but still looks OK).
