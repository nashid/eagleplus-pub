With this method, ``X`` is optional and is only used to build the grid and the partial dependences are computed using the training data. This method does not account for the ``init`` predictor of the boosting process, which may lead to incorrect values (see warning below. With this method, the target response of a classifier is always the decision function, not the predicted probabilities. - 'brute' is supported for any estimator, but is more computationally intensive. - 'auto': - 'recursion' is used for estimators that supports it. - 'brute' is used for all other estimators.",auto,prim_dtype,dtype(string),,1
