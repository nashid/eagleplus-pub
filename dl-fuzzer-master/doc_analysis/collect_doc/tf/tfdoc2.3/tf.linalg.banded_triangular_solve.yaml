constraints:
  adjoint:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. Boolean indicating whether to solve
      with the matrix's block-wise adjoint.
  bands:
    descp: A Tensor describing the bands of the left hand side, with shape [..., K,
      M]. The K rows correspond to the diagonal to the K - 1-th diagonal (the diagonal
      is the top row) when lower is True and otherwise the K - 1-th superdiagonal
      to the diagonal (the diagonal is the bottom row) when lower is False. The bands
      are stored with 'LEFT_RIGHT' alignment, where the superdiagonals are padded
      on the right and subdiagonals are padded on the left. This is the alignment
      cuSPARSE uses. See tf.linalg.set_diag for more details.
  lower:
    default: 'True'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to True. Boolean indicating whether bands represents
      a lower or upper triangular matrix.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name to give this Op (optional).
  rhs:
    descp: A Tensor of shape [..., M] or [..., M, N] and with the same dtype as diagonals.
      Note that if the shape of rhs and/or diags isn't known statically, rhs will
      be treated as a matrix rather than a vector.
inputs:
  optional:
  - lower
