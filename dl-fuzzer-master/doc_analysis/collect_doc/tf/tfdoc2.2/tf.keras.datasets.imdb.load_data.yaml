aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data
constraints:
  '**kwargs':
    default: null
    descp: Used for backwards compatibility.
  index_from:
    default: '3'
    descp: int. Index actual words with this index and higher.
  maxlen:
    default: None
    descp: int or None. Maximum sequence length. Any longer sequence will be truncated.
      Defaults to None, which means no truncation.
  num_words:
    default: None
    descp: integer or None. Words are ranked by how often they occur (in the training
      set) and only the num_words most frequent words are kept. Any less frequent
      word will appear as oov_char value in the sequence data. If None, all words
      are kept. Defaults to None, so all words are kept.
  oov_char:
    default: '2'
    descp: int. The out-of-vocabulary character. Words that were cut out because of
      the num_words or skip_top limits will be replaced with this character.
  path:
    default: imdb.npz
    descp: where to cache the data (relative to ~/.keras/dataset).
  seed:
    default: '113'
    descp: int. Seed for reproducible data shuffling.
  skip_top:
    default: '0'
    descp: skip the top N most frequently occurring words (which may not be informative).
      These words will appear as oov_char value in the dataset. Defaults to 0, so
      no words are skipped.
  start_char:
    default: '1'
    descp: int. The start of a sequence will be marked with this character. Defaults
      to 1 because 0 is usually the padding character.
exceptions:
- ValueError: in case maxlen is so low that no input sequence could be kept.

outputs:
- 'Tuple of Numpy arrays: (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test). x_train, x_test: lists
  of sequences, which are lists of indexes (integers). If the num_words argument was
  specific, the maximum possible index value is num_words-1. If the maxlen argument
  was specified, the largest possible sequence length is maxlen. y_train, y_test:
  lists of integer labels (1 or 0).'
