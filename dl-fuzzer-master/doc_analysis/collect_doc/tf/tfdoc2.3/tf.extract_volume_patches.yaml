constraints:
  input:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64, int32,
      uint8, int16, int8, int64, bfloat16, uint16, half, uint32, uint64. 5-D Tensor
      with shape [batch, in_planes, in_rows, in_cols, depth].'
  ksizes:
    descp: A list of ints that has length >= 5. The size of the sliding window for
      each dimension of input.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  padding:
    descp: 'A string from: "SAME", "VALID". The type of padding algorithm to use.
      We specify the size-related attributes as: ksizes = [1, ksize_planes, ksize_rows,
      ksize_cols, 1] strides = [1, stride_planes, strides_rows, strides_cols, 1]'
  strides:
    descp: 'A list of ints that has length >= 5. 1-D of length 5. How far the centers
      of two consecutive patches are in input. Must be: [1, stride_planes, stride_rows,
      stride_cols, 1].'
