constraints:
  data:
    descp: A `Tensor` with data that will be assembled in the output.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE with data that will be assembled in the output
  indices:
    descp: A 1-D `Tensor` with indices into `data`. Has same rank as`segment_ids`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM-D D_STRUCTURE with indices into PARAM
    - Has same rank as PARAM
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for the operation BSTR
  num_segments:
    default: None
    descp: An optional int32 scalar. Indicates the size of the output`Tensor`.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - An optional D_TYPE scalar
    - Indicates the size of the outputD_STRUCTURE
  segment_ids:
    descp: A 1-D `Tensor` with indices into the output `Tensor`. Values should be
      sorted and can be repeated.
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM-D D_STRUCTURE with PARAM into the output D_STRUCTURE
    - Values should be sorted and can be repeated
inputs:
  optional:
  - num_segments
  - name
  required:
  - data
  - indices
  - segment_ids

outputs: A `tensor` of the shape as data, except for dimension 0 which has size `k`,
  the number of segments specified via `num_segments` or inferred for the last element
  in `segments_ids`.
