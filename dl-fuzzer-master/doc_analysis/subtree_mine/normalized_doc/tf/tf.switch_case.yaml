aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.switch_case
constraints:
  branch_fns:
    descp: A `dict` mapping `int`s to callables, or a `list` of (`int`, callable)
      pairs, or simply a list of callables (in which case the index serves as the
      key). Each callable must return a matching structure of tensors.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE mapping D_TYPEs to callables, or a D_STRUCTURE of BSTR
    - Each callable must return a matching structure of D_STRUCTURE
  branch_index:
    descp: An int Tensor specifying which of `branch_fns` should be executed.
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE D_STRUCTURE specifying which of PARAM should be executed
  default:
    default: None
    descp: Optional callable that returns a structure of tensors.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Optional callable that returns a structure of D_STRUCTURE
  name:
    default: switch_case
    descp: A name for this operation (optional).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for this operation BSTR
exceptions:
- TypeError: If `branch_fns` is not a list/dictionary.
- TypeError: If `branch_fns` is a list but does not contain 2-tuples or        callables.
- TypeError: If `fns[i]` is not callable for any i, or `default` is not        callable.
inputs:
  optional:
  - default
  - name
  required:
  - branch_index
  - branch_fns

outputs: The tensors returned by the callable identified by `branch_index`, or those
  returned by `default` if no key matches and `default` was provided, or those returned
  by the max-keyed `branch_fn` if no `default` is provided.
