aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.Hashing
constraints:
  '**kwargs':
    descp: Keyword arguments to construct a layer.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: Name to give to the layer.
  num_bins:
    descp: Number of hash bins.
  salt:
    default: None
    descp: A single unsigned integer or None. If passed, the hash function used will
      be SipHash64, with these values used as an additional input (known as a "salt"
      in cryptography). These should be non-zero. Defaults to None (in that case,
      the FarmHash64 hash function is used). It also supports tuple/list of 2 unsigned
      integer numbers, see reference paper for details.
inputs:
  optional:
  - salt
  - name
  required:
  - num_bins
  - '**kwargs'
