    descp: 1D integer tensor representing the shape of the binary dropout mask that
      will be multiplied with the input. For instance, if your inputs have shape`(batch_size,
      timesteps, features)` and you want the dropout mask to be the same for all timesteps,
      you can use `noise_shape=(batch_size, 1, features)`.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - CONSTANT_NUM-D D_TYPE D_STRUCTURE representing the shape of the binary dropout
      mask that will be multiplied with the input
    - For instance, if your inputs have shape BSTR and you want the dropout mask to
      be the same for all timesteps, you can use noise_shape BSTR
  rate:
    descp: Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop.
    normalized_descp:
    - D_TYPE between CONSTANT_NUM
    - Fraction of the input units to drop
  seed:
    default: None
    descp: A Python integer to use as random seed.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A Python D_TYPE to use as random seed
inputs:
  optional:
  - noise_shape
  - seed
  - '**kwargs'
