constraints:
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  shape:
    descp: A tf.TensorShape or list of ints. the final shape of the result; should
      be equal to the shapes of any input but with the number of input values in the
      first dimension.
  values:
    descp: A list of at least 1 Tensor objects with the same type. Tensors to be concatenated.
      All must have size 1 in the first dimension and same shape.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - values
  - shape
