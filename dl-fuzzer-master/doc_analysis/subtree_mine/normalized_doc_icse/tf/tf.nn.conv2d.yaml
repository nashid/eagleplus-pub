constraints:
  data_format:
    default: NHWC
    descp: 'An optional `string` from: `"NHWC", "NCHW"`. Defaults to `"NHWC"`. Specify
      the data format of the input and output data. With the default format "NHWC",
      the data is stored in the order of:   [batch, height, width, channels]. Alternatively,
      the format could be "NCHW", the data storage order of:   [batch, channels, height,
      width].'
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - An optional D_TYPE from QSTR
    - Defaults to QSTR
    - Specify the data format of the PARAM and output data
    - With the default format QSTR the data is stored in the order of BSTR
    - Alternatively the format could be QSTR the data storage order of BSTR
  dilations:
    default: None
    descp: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `2` or `4`, defaults to 1.
      The dilation factor for each dimension of`input`. If a single value is given
      it is replicated in the `H` and `W` dimension. By default the `N` and `C` dimensions
      are set to 1. If set to k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between each
      filter element on that dimension. The dimension order is determined by the value
      of `data_format`, see above for details. Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions
      if a 4-d tensor must be 1.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE or D_STRUCTURE of D_TYPE that has length CONSTANT_NUM defaults to
      CONSTANT_NUM
    - The dilation factor for each dimension of PARAM
    - If a single value is given it is replicated in the QSTR dimension
    - By default the QSTR dimensions are set to CONSTANT_NUM
    - If set to k REXPR there will be k CONSTANT_NUM skipped cells between each filter
      element on that dimension
    - The dimension order is determined by the value of PARAM see above for details
    - Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions if a CONSTANT_NUM d D_STRUCTURE
      must be CONSTANT_NUM
  filters:
    descp: A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `input`. A 4-D tensor of shape`[filter_height,
      filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE
    - Must have the same type as PARAM
    - A CONSTANT_NUM D D_STRUCTURE of shape BSTR
  input:
    descp: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types:`half`, `bfloat16`, `float32`,
      `float64`. A 4-D tensor. The dimension order is interpreted according to the
      value of `data_format`, see below for details.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE
    - Must be one of the following types D_TYPE
    - A CONSTANT_NUM D D_STRUCTURE
    - The dimension order is interpreted according to the value of PARAM see below
      for details
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for the operation BSTR
  padding:
    descp: Either the `string` `"SAME"` or `"VALID"` indicating the type of padding
      algorithm to use, or a list indicating the explicit paddings at the start and
      end of each dimension. When explicit padding is used and data_format is `"NHWC"`,
      this should be in the form `[[0, 0], [pad_top, pad_bottom], [pad_left, pad_right],
      [0, 0]]`. When explicit padding used and data_format is `"NCHW"`, this should
      be in the form `[[0, 0], [0, 0], [pad_top, pad_bottom], [pad_left, pad_right]]`.
    normalized_descp:
    - Either the D_TYPE QSTR indicating the type of padding algorithm to use or a
      D_STRUCTURE indicating the explicit paddings at the start and end of each dimension
    - When explicit padding is used and PARAM is QSTR this should be in the form BSTR
      BSTR BSTR BSTR
    - When explicit padding used and PARAM is QSTR this should be in the form BSTR
      BSTR BSTR BSTR
  strides:
    descp: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `2` or `4`.  The stride of
      the sliding window for each dimension of `input`. If a single value is given
      it is replicated in the `H` and `W` dimension. By default the `N` and `C` dimensions
      are set to 1. The dimension order is determined by the value of `data_format`,
      see below for details.
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE or D_STRUCTURE of D_TYPE that has length CONSTANT_NUM
    - The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of PARAM
