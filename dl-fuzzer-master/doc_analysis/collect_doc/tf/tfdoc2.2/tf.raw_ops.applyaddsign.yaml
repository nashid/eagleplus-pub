constraints:
  alpha:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as var. Must be a scalar.
  beta:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as var. Must be a scalar.
  grad:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as var. The gradient.
  lr:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as var. Scaling factor. Must be a scalar.
  m:
    descp: A mutable Tensor. Must have the same type as var. Should be from a Variable().
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  sign_decay:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as var. Must be a scalar.
  use_locking:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. If True, updating of the var and m
      tensors is protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may
      exhibit less contention.
  var:
    descp: 'A mutable Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64,
      int32, uint8, int16, int8, complex64, int64, qint8, quint8, qint32, bfloat16,
      uint16, complex128, half, uint32, uint64. Should be from a Variable().'
