constraints:
  data_format:
    descp: A string, only "NHWC" is currently supported.
  dilations:
    descp: 'A list of ints that has length >= 4. 1-D of length 4. The input stride
      for atrous morphological dilation. Must be: [1, rate_height, rate_width, 1].'
  filters:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as value. 3-D with shape [filters_height,
      filters_width, depth].
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional). If not specified "erosion2d" is used.
  padding:
    descp: 'A string from: "SAME", "VALID". The type of padding algorithm to use.'
  strides:
    descp: 'A list of ints that has length >= 4. 1-D of length 4. The stride of the
      sliding window for each dimension of the input tensor. Must be: [1, stride_height,
      stride_width, 1].'
  value:
    descp: A Tensor. 4-D with shape [batch, in_height, in_width, depth].
exceptions:
- ValueError: If the value depth does not match filters' shape, or if padding is other
    than 'VALID' or 'SAME'.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - value
  - filters
  - strides
  - padding
  - data_format
