constraints:
  input_dataset:
    descp: A Tensor of type variant.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_shapes:
    descp: A list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints) that has length
      >= 1.
  output_types:
    descp: A list of tf.DTypes that has length >= 1.
  rate:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. A scalar representing the sample rate. Each element
      of input_dataset is retained with this probability, independent of all other
      elements.
  seed:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. A scalar representing seed of random number generator.
  seed2:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. A scalar representing seed2 of random number generator.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - input_dataset
  - rate
  - seed
  - seed2
  - output_types
