constraints:
  filters:
    descp: A 4-D `Tensor` with the same type as `value` and shape`[filter_height,
      filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`. `filters`'`in_channels` dimension
      must match that of `value`. Atrous convolution is equivalent to standard convolution
      with upsampled filters with effective height `filter_height + (filter_height
      - 1) * (rate - 1)` and effective width `filter_width + (filter_width - 1) *
      (rate - 1)`, produced by inserting `rate - 1` zeros along consecutive elements
      across the`filters`' spatial dimensions.
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM D D_STRUCTURE with the same type as PARAM and shape BSTR
    - QSTR in_channels dimension must match that of PARAM
    - Atrous convolution is equivalent to standard convolution with upsampled filters
      with effective height QSTR filter_width BSTR produced by inserting PARAM CONSTANT_NUM
      zeros along consecutive elements across the QSTR spatial dimensions
  name:
    default: None
    descp: Optional name for the returned tensor.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Optional name for the returned D_STRUCTURE
  padding:
    descp: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE either QSTR
    - The padding algorithm
  rate:
    descp: A positive int32. The stride with which we sample input values across the
      `height` and `width` dimensions. Equivalently, the rate by which we upsample
      the filter values by inserting zeros across the `height` and`width` dimensions.
      In the literature, the same parameter is sometimes called `input stride` or
      `dilation`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A positive D_TYPE
    - The stride with which we sample input values across the QSTR dimensions
    - Equivalently the rate by which we upsample the filter values by inserting zeros
      across the QSTR dimensions
    - In the literature the same parameter is sometimes called QSTR
  value:
    descp: A 4-D `Tensor` of type `float`. It needs to be in the default "NHWC" format.
      Its shape is `[batch, in_height, in_width, in_channels]`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM D D_STRUCTURE of type D_TYPE
    - It needs to be in the default QSTR format
    - Its shape is BSTR
exceptions:
- ValueError: If input/output depth does not match `filters`' shape, or if padding
    is other than `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`.

  - name
