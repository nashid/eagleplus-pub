constraints:
  indices:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. A Tensor.
      Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. A tensor of indices into ref.'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  ref:
    descp: A Tensor of type resource. A resource handle. Must be from a VarHandleOp.
  updates:
    descp: A Tensor. A Tensor. Must have the same type as ref. A tensor of values
      whose element wise min is taken with ref.
  use_locking:
    default: 'True'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to True. An optional bool. Defaults to True.
      If True, the assignment will be protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior
      is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.
inputs:
  optional:
  - use_locking
  - name
  required:
  - ref
  - indices
  - updates
