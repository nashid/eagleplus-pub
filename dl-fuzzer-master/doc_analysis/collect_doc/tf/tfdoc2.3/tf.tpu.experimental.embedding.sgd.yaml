aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.tpu.experimental.embedding.SGD
constraints:
  clip_weight_max:
    default: None
    descp: the maximum value to clip by; None means +infinity.
  clip_weight_min:
    default: None
    descp: the minimum value to clip by; None means -infinity.
  learning_rate:
    default: '0.01'
    descp: The learning rate. It should be a floating point value or a callable taking
      no arguments for a dynamic learning rate.
  multiply_weight_decay_factor_by_learning_rate:
    default: None
    descp: if true, weight_decay_factor is multiplied by the current learning rate.
  weight_decay_factor:
    default: None
    descp: amount of weight decay to apply; None means that the weights are not decayed.
      Weights are decayed by multiplying the weight by this factor each step.

  optional:
  - learning_rate
  - clip_weight_min
  - clip_weight_max
