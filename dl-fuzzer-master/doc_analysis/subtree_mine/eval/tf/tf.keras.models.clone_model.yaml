  clone_function:
    default: None
    descp: 'Callable to be used to clone each layer in the target model (except `InputLayer`
      instances). It takes as argument the layer instance to be cloned, and returns
      the corresponding layer instance to be used in the model copy. If unspecified,
      this callable defaults to the following serialization/deserialization function:`lambda
      layer: layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())`. By passing a custom
      callable, you can customize your copy of the model, e.g. by wrapping certain
      layers of interest (you might want to replace all `LSTM` instances with equivalent`Bidirectional(LSTM(...))`
      instances, for example).'
