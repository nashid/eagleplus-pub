aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.vectorized_map
constraints:
  elems:
    descp: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, each of which will be
      unpacked along their first dimension. The nested sequence of the resulting slices
      will be mapped over by fn.
    structure:
    - list
    - list(tf.tensor)
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  fallback_to_while_loop:
    default: 'True'
    descp: If true, on failing to vectorize an operation, the unsupported op is wrapped
      in a tf.while_loop to execute the map iterations. Note that this fallback only
      happens for unsupported ops and other parts of fn are still vectorized. If false,
      on encountering an unsupported op, a ValueError is thrown. Note that the fallbacks
      can result in slowdowns since vectorization often yields speedup of one to two
      orders of magnitude.
    dtype:
    - tf.bool
    ndim:
    - '0'
  fn:
    descp: The callable to be performed. It accepts one argument, which will have
      the same (possibly nested) structure as elems, and returns a possibly nested
      structure of Tensors and Operations, which may be different than the structure
      of elems.
    dtype:
    - callable
exceptions:
- ValueError: If vectorization fails and fallback_to_while_loop is False.
inputs:
  optional:
  - fallback_to_while_loop
  required:
  - fn
  - elems

outputs:
- A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors. Each tensor packs the results
  of applying fn to tensors unpacked from elems along the first dimension, from first
  to last.
