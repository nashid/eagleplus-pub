constraints:
  accum:
    descp: A Tensor of type resource. Should be from a Variable().
  grad:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as lr. The gradient.
  indices:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. A vector of
      indices into the first dimension of var and accum.'
  lr:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64, int32,
      uint8, int16, int8, complex64, int64, qint8, quint8, qint32, bfloat16, uint16,
      complex128, half, uint32, uint64. Learning rate. Must be a scalar.'
  momentum:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as lr. Momentum. Must be a scalar.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  use_locking:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. If True, updating of the var and accum
      tensors will be protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but
      may exhibit less contention.
  use_nesterov:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. If True, the tensor passed to compute
      grad will be var + momentum * accum, so in the end, the var you get is actually
      var + momentum * accum.
  var:
    descp: A Tensor of type resource. Should be from a Variable().
