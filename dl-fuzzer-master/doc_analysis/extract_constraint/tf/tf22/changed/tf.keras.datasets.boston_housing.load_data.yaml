outputs:
- 'Tuple of Numpy arrays: (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test). x_train, x_test: numpy
  arrays with shape (num_samples, 13) containing either the training samples (for
  x_train), or test samples (for y_train) y_train, y_test: numpy arrays of shape (num_samples,
  ) containing the target scalars. The targets are float scalars typically between
  10 and 50 that represent the home prices in k$.'
