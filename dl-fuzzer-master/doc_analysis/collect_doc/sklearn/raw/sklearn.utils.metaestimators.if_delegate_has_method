sklearn.utils.metaestimators.if_delegate_has_method = if_delegate_has_method(delegate)
    Create a decorator for methods that are delegated to a sub-estimator
    
    This enables ducktyping by hasattr returning True according to the
    sub-estimator.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    delegate : string, list of strings or tuple of strings
        Name of the sub-estimator that can be accessed as an attribute of the
