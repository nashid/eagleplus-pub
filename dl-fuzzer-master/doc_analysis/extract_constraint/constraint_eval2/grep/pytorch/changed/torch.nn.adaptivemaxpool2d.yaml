constraints:
  output_size:
    descp: the target output size of the image of the form H x W. Can be a tuple (H,
      W) or a single H for a square image H x H. H and W can be either a `int`, or
      `None` which means the size will be the same as that of the input.
    dtype:
    - int
    structure:
    - tuple
  return_indices:
    default: 'False'
    descp: 'if `True`, will return the indices along with the outputs. Useful to pass
      to nn.MaxUnpool2d. Default: `False`'
inputs:
  optional:
  - return_indices
  required:
  - output_size
