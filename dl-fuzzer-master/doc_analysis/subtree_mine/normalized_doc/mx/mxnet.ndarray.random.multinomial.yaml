  data:
    descp: An n dimensional array whose last dimension has length k, where k is the
      number of possible outcomes of each multinomial distribution. For example, data
      with shape (m, n, k) specifies m*n multinomial distributions each with k possible
      outcomes.
    doc_dtype: NDArray
    normalized_descp:
    - An n dimensional D_STRUCTURE whose last dimension has length k, where k is the
      number of possible outcomes of each multinomial distribution
    - For example, data with PARAM BSTR specifies m n multinomial distributions each
      with k possible outcomes
    normalized_docdtype: ONE_WORD D_STRUCTURE
  dtype:
    default: int32
    descp: Data type of the sample output array. The default is int32. Note that the
      data type of the log likelihood array is the same with that of data.
    doc_dtype: str or numpy.dtype, optional
    normalized_default: DEFAULT D_TYPE
    normalized_descp:
    - PARAM type of the sample output D_STRUCTURE
    - The default is D_TYPE
    - Note that the PARAM type of the log likelihood D_STRUCTURE is the same with
      that of PARAM
    normalized_docdtype: D_TYPE, optional
  get_prob:
    default: 'False'
    descp: If true, a second array containing log likelihood of the drawn samples
      will also be returned. This is usually used for reinforcement learning, where
      you can provide reward as head gradient w.r.t. this array to estimate gradient.
    doc_dtype: bool, optional
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_descp:
    - If CONSTANT_BOOL, a second D_STRUCTURE containing log likelihood of the drawn
      samples will also be returned
    - This is usually used for reinforcement learning, where you can provide reward
      as head gradient w r t
    - this D_STRUCTURE to estimate gradient
    normalized_docdtype: D_TYPE, optional
  out:
    default: None
    descp: Store output to an existing NDArray.
    doc_dtype: NDArray, optional
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Store output to an existing D_STRUCTURE
    normalized_docdtype: D_STRUCTURE, optional
  shape:
    default: _Null
    descp: The number of samples to draw from each distribution. If shape is empty
      one sample will be drawn from each distribution.
    doc_dtype: int or tuple of ints, optional
    normalized_default: DEFAULT Null
    normalized_descp:
    - The number of samples to draw from each distribution
    - If shape is empty one sample will be drawn from each distribution
