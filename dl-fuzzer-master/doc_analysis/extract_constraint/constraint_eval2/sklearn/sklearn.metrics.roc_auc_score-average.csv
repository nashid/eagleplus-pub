,"{'micro', 'macro', 'samples', 'weighted'} or None,             default='macro' If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this determines the type of averaging performed on the data: Note: multiclass ROC AUC currently only handles the 'macro' and 'weighted' averages. ``'micro'``: Calculate metrics globally by considering each element of the label indicator matrix as a label. ``'macro'``: Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account. ``'weighted'``: Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted by support (the number of true instances for each label). ``'samples'``: Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average. Will be ignored when ``y_true`` is binary.",macro,prim_dtype,dtype(string),,1
