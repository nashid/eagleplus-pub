,"If provided, contains a name of a ""known"" function this implements. For example ""mycompany.my_recurrent_cell"". This is stored as an attribute in inference function, which can then be detected when processing serialized function. Seehttps://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190610-standardizing-composite_ops.mdfor details.  For an example of utilizing this attribute see:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/compiler/mlir/lite/transforms/prepare_composite_functions_tf.ccThe code above automatically detects and substitutes function that implements ""embedded_matmul"" and allows TFLite to substitute its own implementations. For instance, a tensorflow user can use this attribute to mark that their function also implements`embedded_matmul``` (perhaps more efficiently!) by specifying it using this flag.",None,,,0,0
