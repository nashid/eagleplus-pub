constraints:
  data_format:
    default: None
    descp: A string or None.  Specifies whether the channel dimension of the `input`
      and output is the last dimension (default, or if `data_format`does not start
      with "NC"), or the second dimension (if `data_format`starts with "NC").  For
      N=1, the valid values are "NWC" (default) and "NCW".  For N=2, the valid values
      are "NHWC" (default) and "NCHW". For N=3, the valid values are "NDHWC" (default)
      and "NCDHW".
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE or None
    - Specifies whether the channel dimension of the PARAM and output is the last
      dimension default, or if QSTR does not start with QSTR , or the second dimension
      if QSTR starts with QSTR
    - For N CONSTANT_NUM, the valid values are QSTR BSTR and QSTR
    - For N CONSTANT_NUM, the valid values are QSTR BSTR and QSTR
    - For N CONSTANT_NUM, the valid values are QSTR BSTR and QSTR
  dilations:
    default: None
    descp: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `N` or `N+2`, defaults to
      1. The dilation factor for each dimension of`input`. If a single value is given
      it is replicated in the spatial dimensions. By default the `N` and `C` dimensions
      are set to 1. If set to k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between each
      filter element on that dimension. The dimension order is determined by the value
      of `data_format`, see above for details.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE or D_STRUCTURE of D_TYPE that has length CONSTANT_NUM, QSTR or N CONSTANT_NUM,
      defaults to CONSTANT_NUM
    - The dilation factor for each dimension of PARAM
    - If a single value is given it is replicated in the spatial dimensions
    - By default the QSTR dimensions are set to CONSTANT_NUM
    - If set to k REXPR, there will be k CONSTANT_NUM skipped cells between each filter
      element on that dimension
    - The dimension order is determined by the value of PARAM, see above for details
  filters:
    descp: An N+2 dimensional `Tensor` with the same type as `input` and shape `spatial_filter_shape
      + [in_channels, out_channels]`.
    normalized_descp:
    - An N CONSTANT_NUM dimensional D_STRUCTURE with the same type as PARAM and shape
      spatial_filter_shape BSTR
  input:
    descp: An N+2 dimensional `Tensor` of shape`[batch_size] + input_spatial_shape
      + [in_channels]` if data_format does not start with "NC" (default), or`[batch_size,
      in_channels] + input_spatial_shape` if data_format starts with "NC". It must
      be one of the following types:`half`, `bfloat16`, `float32`, `float64`.
    normalized_descp:
    - An N CONSTANT_NUM dimensional D_STRUCTURE of shape BSTR input_spatial_shape
      BSTR if PARAM does not start with QSTR BSTR, or BSTR input_spatial_shape QSTR
      NC
    - It must be one of the following types D_TYPE
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional). If not specified "conv_transpose"
      is used.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for the operation BSTR
    - If not specified QSTR is used
  output_shape:
    descp: A 1-D `Tensor` representing the output shape of the deconvolution op.
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM-D D_STRUCTURE representing the output shape of the deconvolution
      op
  padding:
    default: SAME
    descp: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm. See the
      "returns" section of `tf.nn.convolution` for details.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE, either QSTR
    - The padding algorithm
    - See the QSTR section of tf nn convolution for details
  strides:
    descp: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `N` or `N+2`.  The stride
      of the sliding window for each dimension of `input`. If a single value is given
      it is replicated in the spatial dimensions. By default the `N` and `C` dimensions
      are set to 0. The dimension order is determined by the value of `data_format`,
      see below for details.
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE or D_STRUCTURE of D_TYPE that has length CONSTANT_NUM, QSTR or N CONSTANT_NUM
    - The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of PARAM
    - If a single value is given it is replicated in the spatial dimensions
