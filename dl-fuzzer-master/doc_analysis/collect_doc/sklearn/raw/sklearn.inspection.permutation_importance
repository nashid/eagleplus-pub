sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance = permutation_importance(estimator, X, y, scoring=None, n_repeats=5, n_jobs=None, random_state=None)
    Permutation importance for feature evaluation [BRE]_.
    
    The :term:`estimator` is required to be a fitted estimator. `X` can be the
    data set used to train the estimator or a hold-out set. The permutation
    importance of a feature is calculated as follows. First, a baseline metric,
    defined by :term:`scoring`, is evaluated on a (potentially different)
    dataset defined by the `X`. Next, a feature column from the validation set
    is permuted and the metric is evaluated again. The permutation importance
    is defined to be the difference between the baseline metric and metric from
    permutating the feature column.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object
        An estimator that has already been :term:`fitted` and is compatible
        with :term:`scorer`.
    
    X : ndarray or DataFrame, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Data on which permutation importance will be computed.
    
    y : array-like or None, shape (n_samples, ) or (n_samples, n_classes)
        Targets for supervised or `None` for unsupervised.
    
    scoring : string, callable or None, default=None
        Scorer to use. It can be a single
        string (see :ref:`scoring_parameter`) or a callable (see
        :ref:`scoring`). If None, the estimator's default scorer is used.
    
    n_repeats : int, default=5
        Number of times to permute a feature.
    
    n_jobs : int or None, default=None
        The number of jobs to use for the computation.
        `None` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        `-1` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.
    
    random_state : int, RandomState instance, or None, default=None
        Pseudo-random number generator to control the permutations of each
        feature. See :term:`random_state`.
    
    Returns
    -------
    result : Bunch
        Dictionary-like object, with attributes:
    
        importances_mean : ndarray, shape (n_features, )
            Mean of feature importance over `n_repeats`.
        importances_std : ndarray, shape (n_features, )
            Standard deviation over `n_repeats`.
        importances : ndarray, shape (n_features, n_repeats)
            Raw permutation importance scores.
