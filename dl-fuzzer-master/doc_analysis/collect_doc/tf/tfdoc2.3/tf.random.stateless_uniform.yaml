constraints:
  dtype:
    default: tf.dtypes.float32
    descp: 'The type of the output: float16, float32, float64, int32, or int64. For
      unbounded uniform ints (minval, maxval both None), uint32 and uint64 may be
      used.'
  maxval:
    default: None
    descp: A Tensor or Python value of type dtype, broadcastable with shape (for integer
      types, broadcasting is not supported, so it needs to be a scalar). The upper
      bound on the range of random values to generate. Defaults to 1 if dtype is floating
      point. Pass None for full-range integers.
  minval:
    default: '0'
    descp: A Tensor or Python value of type dtype, broadcastable with shape (for integer
      types, broadcasting is not supported, so it needs to be a scalar). The lower
      bound on the range of random values to generate. Pass None for full-range integers.
      Defaults to 0.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  seed:
    descp: A shape [2] Tensor, the seed to the random number generator. Must have
      dtype int32 or int64. (When using XLA, only int32 is allowed.)
  shape:
    descp: A 1-D integer Tensor or Python array. The shape of the output tensor.
exceptions:
- ValueError: If dtype is integral and only one of minval or maxval is specified.
inputs:
  optional:
  - minval
  - maxval
  - dtype
  - name
  required:
  - shape
