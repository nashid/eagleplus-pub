,"A function which should obey the following signature: Args: can only have following four arguments in any order:predictions: Predictions `Tensor` or dict of `Tensor` created by given`estimator`.features: Input `dict` of `Tensor` objects created by `input_fn` which is given to `estimator.evaluate` as an argument.labels:  Labels `Tensor` or dict of `Tensor` created by `input_fn`which is given to `estimator.evaluate` as an argument.config: config attribute of the `estimator`.Returns: Dict of metric results keyed by name. Final metrics are a union of this and `estimator's` existing metrics. If there is a name conflict between this and `estimator`s existing metrics, this will override the existing one. The values of the dict are the results of calling a metric function, namely a `(metric_tensor, update_op)` tuple. ",,prim_dtype,dtype(callable),,1
