constraints:
  dims:
    default: None
    descp: Axis along which to roll
    doc_dtype: int or tuple of python:ints
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Axis along which to roll
    normalized_docdtype: D_TYPE or D_STRUCTURE of python D_TYPE
  input:
    descp: the input tensor.
    doc_dtype: Tensor
    normalized_descp:
    - the input D_STRUCTURE
    normalized_docdtype: ONE_WORD D_STRUCTURE
  shifts:
    descp: The number of places by which the elements of the tensor are shifted. If
      shifts is a tuple, dims must be a tuple of the same size, and each dimension
      will be rolled by the corresponding value
    doc_dtype: int or tuple of python:ints
    normalized_descp:
    - The number of places by which the elements of the D_STRUCTURE are shifted
    - If shifts is a D_STRUCTURE, PARAM must be a D_STRUCTURE of the same size, and
      each dimension will be rolled by the corresponding value
    normalized_docdtype: D_TYPE or D_STRUCTURE of python D_TYPE
inputs:
  optional:
  - dims
  required:
  - input
  - shifts
