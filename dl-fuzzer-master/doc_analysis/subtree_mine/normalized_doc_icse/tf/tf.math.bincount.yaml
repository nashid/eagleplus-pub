constraints:
  arr:
    descp: An int32 tensor of non-negative values.
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE D_STRUCTURE of non negative values
  dtype:
    default: tf.dtypes.int32
    descp: If `weights` is None, determines the type of the output bins.
    normalized_default: D_TYPE D_TYPE
    normalized_descp:
    - If PARAM is None determines the type of the output bins
  maxlength:
    default: None
    descp: If given, skips values in `arr` that are equal or greater than`maxlength`,
      ensuring that the output has length at most `maxlength`.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - If given skips values in PARAM that are equal or greater than QSTR ensuring
      that the output has length at most QSTR
  minlength:
    default: None
    descp: If given, ensures the output has length at least `minlength`, padding with
      zeros at the end if necessary.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - If given ensures the output has length at least QSTR padding with zeros at the
      end if necessary
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name scope for the associated operations (optional).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A name scope for the associated operations BSTR
  weights:
    default: None
    descp: If non-None, must be the same shape as arr. For each value in`arr`, the
      bin will be incremented by the corresponding weight instead of 1.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - If non None must be the same shape as PARAM
    - For each value in PARAM the bin will be incremented by the corresponding weight
      instead of CONSTANT_NUM
exceptions: '`InvalidArgumentError` if negative values are provided as an input.'
inputs:
  optional:
  - weights
  - minlength
  - maxlength
  - dtype
  - name
  required:
  - arr
