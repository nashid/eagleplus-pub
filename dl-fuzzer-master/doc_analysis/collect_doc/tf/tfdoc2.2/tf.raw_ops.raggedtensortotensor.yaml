constraints:
  default_value:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as values. The default_value when the
      shape is larger than the ragged tensor. The default_value is broadcast until
      it is the shape of the output tensor, and then overwritten by values in the
      ragged tensor. The default value must be compatible with this broadcast operation,
      and must have fewer dimensions than the value tensor.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  row_partition_tensors:
    descp: 'A list of at least 1 Tensor objects with the same type in: int64, int32.'
  row_partition_types:
    descp: 'A list of strings. The types of the row partition tensors. At present,
      these can be: "ROW_SPLITS": the row_splits tensor from the ragged tensor. "VALUE_ROWIDS":
      the value_rowids tensor from the ragged tensor. "FIRST_DIM_SIZE": if value_rowids
      is used for the first dimension, then it is preceeded by "FIRST_DIM_SIZE". The
      tensors are in the order of the dimensions.'
  shape:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int64, int32. The desired
      shape of the the output tensor. If left unspecified (empty), the minimal shape
      required to contain all the elements in the ragged tensor (the natural shape)
      will be used. If some dimensions are left unspecified, then the size of the
      natural shape is used in that dimension. Note that dense dimensions cannot be
      modified by the shape argument. Trying to change the size of a dense dimension
      will cause the op to fail. Examples: natural shape: [4, 5, 6] shape: -1 output
      shape: [4, 5, 6] natural shape: [4, 5, 6] shape: [3, -1, 2] output shape: [3,
      5, 2] natural shape: [4, 5, 6] shape: [3, 7, 2] output shape: [3, 7, 2]'
  values:
    descp: A Tensor. A 1D tensor representing the values of the ragged tensor.
