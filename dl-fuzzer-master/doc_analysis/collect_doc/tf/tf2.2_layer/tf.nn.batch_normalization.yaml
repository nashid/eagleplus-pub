aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.nn.batch_normalization
constraints:
  mean:
    descp: A mean Tensor.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for this operation (optional).
  offset:
    descp: An offset Tensor, often denoted \(\beta\) in equations, or None. If present,
      will be added to the normalized tensor.
  scale:
    descp: A scale Tensor, often denoted \(\gamma\) in equations, or None. If present,
      the scale is applied to the normalized tensor.
  variance:
    descp: A variance Tensor.
  variance_epsilon:
    descp: A small float number to avoid dividing by 0.
  x:
    descp: Input Tensor of arbitrary dimensionality.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - x
  - mean
  - variance
  - offset
  - scale
  - variance_epsilon
