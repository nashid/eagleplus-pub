constraints:
  input:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. The strings for which to compute the length for
      each element.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  unit:
    default: BYTE
    descp: 'An optional string from: "BYTE", "UTF8_CHAR". Defaults to "BYTE". The
      unit that is counted to compute string length. One of: "BYTE" (for the number
      of bytes in each string) or "UTF8_CHAR" (for the number of UTF-8 encoded Unicode
      code points in each string). Results are undefined if unit=UTF8_CHAR and the
      input strings do not contain structurally valid UTF-8.'
