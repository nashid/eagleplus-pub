constraints:
  '**kwargs':
    descp: ''
  noise_shape:
    default: None
    descp: ''
  rate:
    descp: float, drop probability (as with Dropout). The multiplicative noise will
      have standard deviation sqrt(rate / (1 - rate)).
  seed:
    default: None
    descp: A Python integer to use as random seed.
inputs:
  optional:
  - noise_shape
  - seed
  required:
  - rate
  - '**kwargs'
