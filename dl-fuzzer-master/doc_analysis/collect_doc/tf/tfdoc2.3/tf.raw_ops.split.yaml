constraints:
  axis:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. 0-D. The dimension along which to split. Must be
      in the range [-rank(value), rank(value)).
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  num_split:
    descp: An int that is >= 1. The number of ways to split. Must evenly divide value.shape[split_dim].
  value:
    descp: A Tensor. The tensor to split.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
