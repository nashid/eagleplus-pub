constraints:
  full_matrices:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. If true, compute full-sized q and
      r. If false (the default), compute only the leading P columns of q.
  input:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float64, float32, half,
      complex64, complex128. A tensor of shape [..., M, N] whose inner-most 2 dimensions
      form matrices of size [M, N]. Let P be the minimum of M and N.'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
inputs:
  optional:
  - full_matrices
