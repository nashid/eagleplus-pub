constraints:
  data_format:
    default: NWC
    descp: An optional `string` from `"NWC", "NCW"`.  Defaults to `"NWC"`, the data
      is stored in the order of [batch, in_width, in_channels].  The`"NCW"` format
      stores data as [batch, in_channels, in_width].
    normalized_default: DEFAULT DF_STR
    normalized_descp:
    - An optional D_TYPE from QSTR
    - Defaults to QSTR the data is stored in the order of BSTR
    - The QSTR format stores data as BSTR
  dilations:
    default: None
    descp: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1` or `3` which defaults to 1.
      The dilation factor for each dimension of input. If set to k > 1, there will
      be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that dimension. Dilations
      in the batch and depth dimensions must be 1.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE or D_STRUCTURE of D_TYPE that has length CONSTANT_NUM which defaults
      to CONSTANT_NUM
    - The dilation factor for each dimension of PARAM
    - If set to k REXPR there will be k CONSTANT_NUM skipped cells between each filter
      element on that dimension
    - Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions must be CONSTANT_NUM
  filters:
    descp: A 3D `Tensor`.  Must have the same type as `input`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM D D_STRUCTURE
    - Must have the same type as PARAM
  input:
    descp: A 3D `Tensor`.  Must be of type `float16`, `float32`, or `float64`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A CONSTANT_NUM D D_STRUCTURE
    - Must be of type D_TYPE
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for the operation BSTR
  padding:
    descp: '''SAME'' or ''VALID'''
    normalized_descp:
    - ONE_WORD QSTR
  stride:
    descp: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1` or `3`.  The number of entries
      by which the filter is moved right at each step.
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE or D_STRUCTURE of D_TYPE that has length CONSTANT_NUM
    - The number of entries by which the filter is moved right at each step
exceptions:
- ValueError: if `data_format` is invalid.
inputs:
  optional:
  - data_format
  - dilations
  - name
  required:
  - input
  - filters
  - stride
