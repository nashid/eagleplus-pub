constraints:
  data:
    descp: A `Tensor` representing pixel data with shape `[k, h, w, c]`, where `k`
      is the number of images, `h` and `w` are the height and width of the images,
      and `c` is the number of channels, which should be 1, 2, 3, or 4 (grayscale,
      grayscale with alpha, RGB, RGBA). Any of the dimensions may be statically unknown
      (i.e., `None`). Floating point data will be clipped to the range [0,1).
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE representing pixel data with shape BSTR where QSTR is the number
      of images QSTR are the height and width of the images and QSTR is the number
      of channels which should be CONSTANT_NUM BSTR
    - Any of the dimensions may be statically unknown i e QSTR
    - D_TYPE point data will be clipped to the range BSTR
  description:
    default: None
    descp: Optional long-form description for this summary, as a constant `str`. Markdown
      is supported. Defaults to empty.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Optional long form description for this summary as a constant D_TYPE
    - Markdown is supported
    - Defaults to empty
  max_outputs:
    default: '3'
    descp: Optional `int` or rank-0 integer `Tensor`. At most this many images will
      be emitted at each step. When more than`max_outputs` many images are provided,
      the first `max_outputs` many images will be used and the rest silently discarded.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_NUM
    normalized_descp:
    - Optional D_TYPE or rank CONSTANT_NUM D_TYPE D_STRUCTURE
    - At most this many images will be emitted at each PARAM
    - When more than QSTR many images are provided the first QSTR many images will
      be used and the rest silently discarded
  name:
    descp: A name for this summary. The summary tag used for TensorBoard will be this
      name prefixed by any active name scopes.
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for this summary
    - The summary tag used for TensorBoard will be this name prefixed by any active
      name scopes
  step:
    default: None
    descp: Explicit `int64`-castable monotonic step value for this summary. If omitted,
      this defaults to `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`, which must not be None.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Explicit D_TYPE castable monotonic step value for this summary
    - If omitted this defaults to tf summary experimental get_step which must not
      be None
exceptions:
- ValueError: if a default writer exists, but no step was provided and`tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`
    is None.

outputs: True on success, or false if no summary was emitted because no default summary
  writer was available.
