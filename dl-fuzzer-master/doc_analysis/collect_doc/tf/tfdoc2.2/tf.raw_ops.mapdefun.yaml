constraints:
  arguments:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects. A list of tensors whose types are Targuments,
      corresponding to the inputs the function should be mapped over.
  captured_inputs:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects. A list of tensors whose types are Tcaptured,
      corresponding to the captured inputs of the defun.
  f:
    descp: A function decorated with @Defun.
  max_intra_op_parallelism:
    default: '1'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 1.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_shapes:
    descp: A list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints) that has length
      >= 1. A list of shapes.
  output_types:
    descp: A list of tf.DTypes that has length >= 1. A list of types.
