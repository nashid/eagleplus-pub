aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.repeat
constraints:
  axis:
    default: None
    descp: An int. The axis along which to repeat values. By default (axis=None),
      use the flattened input array, and return a flat output array.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE
    - The axis along which to repeat values
    - By default axis None use the flattened PARAM D_STRUCTURE and return a flat output
      D_STRUCTURE
  input:
    descp: An `N`-dimensional Tensor.
    normalized_descp:
    - An QSTR dimensional D_STRUCTURE
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for the operation
  repeats:
    descp: An 1-D `int` Tensor. The number of repetitions for each element. repeats
      is broadcasted to fit the shape of the given axis. `len(repeats)`must equal
      `input.shape[axis]` if axis is not None.
    normalized_descp:
    - An CONSTANT_NUM D D_TYPE D_STRUCTURE
    - The number of repetitions for each element
    - repeats is broadcasted to fit the shape of the given PARAM
    - len BSTRmust equal PARAM shape BSTR if PARAM is not None
inputs:
  optional:
  - axis
  - name
  required:
  - input
  - repeats
link: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.1/api_docs/python/tf/repeat
outputs: A Tensor which has the same shape as `input`, except along the given axis.   If
  axis is None then the output array is flattened to match the flattened   input array.
