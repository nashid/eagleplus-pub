constraints:
  dtype:
    default: tf.dtypes.int32
    descp: Data type of the confusion matrix.
  labels:
    descp: 1-D Tensor of real labels for the classification task.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: Scope name.
  num_classes:
    default: None
    descp: The possible number of labels the classification task can have. If this
      value is not provided, it will be calculated using both predictions and labels
      array.
  predictions:
    descp: 1-D Tensor of predictions for a given classification.
  weights:
    default: None
    descp: An optional Tensor whose shape matches predictions.
exceptions:
- ValueError: If both predictions and labels are not 1-D vectors and have mismatched
    shapes, or if weights is not None and its shape doesn't match predictions.
inputs:
  optional:
  - num_classes
  - weights
  - dtype
  - name
  required:
  - labels
  - predictions

outputs:
- A Tensor of type dtype with shape [n, n] representing the confusion matrix, where
  n is the number of possible labels in the classification task.
