constraints:
  bias:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as value. 1-D with size the last dimension
      of value.
  data_format:
    default: NHWC
    descp: 'An optional string from: "NHWC", "NCHW". Defaults to "NHWC". Specify the
      data format of the input and output data. With the default format "NHWC", the
      bias tensor will be added to the last dimension of the value tensor. Alternatively,
      the format could be "NCHW", the data storage order of: [batch, in_channels,
      in_height, in_width]. The tensor will be added to "in_channels", the third-to-the-last
      dimension.'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  value:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64, int32,
      uint8, int16, int8, complex64, int64, qint8, quint8, qint32, bfloat16, uint16,
      complex128, half, uint32, uint64. Any number of dimensions.'
