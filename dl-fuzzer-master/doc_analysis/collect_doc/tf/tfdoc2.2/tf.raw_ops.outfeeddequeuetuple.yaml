constraints:
  device_ordinal:
    default: '-1'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to -1. The TPU device to use. This should be
      -1 when the Op is running on a TPU device, and >= 0 when the Op is running on
      the CPU device.
  dtypes:
    descp: A list of tf.DTypes that has length >= 1. The element types of each element
      in outputs.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  shapes:
    descp: A list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints). The shapes of
      each tensor in outputs.
inputs:
  optional:
  - device_ordinal
  - name
  required:
  - dtypes
  - shapes
