constraints:
  diagonals:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float64, float32, complex64,
      complex128. Tensor of shape [..., 3, M] whose innermost 2 dimensions represent
      the tridiagonal matrices with three rows being the superdiagonal, diagonals,
      and subdiagonals, in order. The last element of the superdiagonal and the first
      element of the subdiagonal is ignored.'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  partial_pivoting:
    default: 'True'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to True. Whether to apply partial pivoting.
      Partial pivoting makes the procedure more stable, but slower.
  rhs:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as diagonals. Tensor of shape [..., M,
      K], representing K right-hand sides per each left-hand side.
inputs:
  optional:
  - partial_pivoting
  - name
  required:
  - diagonals
  - rhs
