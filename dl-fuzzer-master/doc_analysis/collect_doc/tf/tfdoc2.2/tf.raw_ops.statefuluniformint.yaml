constraints:
  algorithm:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. The RNG algorithm.
  maxval:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as minval. Maximum value (exclusive,
      scalar).
  minval:
    descp: A Tensor. Minimum value (inclusive, scalar).
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  resource:
    descp: A Tensor of type resource. The handle of the resource variable that stores
      the state of the RNG.
  shape:
    descp: A Tensor. The shape of the output tensor.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - resource
  - algorithm
