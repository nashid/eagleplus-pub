aliases:
- tf.math.log_softmax
constraints:
  axis:
    default: None
    descp: The dimension softmax would be performed on. The default is -1 which indicates
      the last dimension.
  logits:
    descp: 'A non-empty Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, float32,
      float64.'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
exceptions:
- InvalidArgumentError: if logits is empty or axis is beyond the last dimension of
    logits.
inputs:
  optional:
  - axis
  - name
  required:
  - logits
