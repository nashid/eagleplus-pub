constraints:
  feature_indices:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. int32; Rank 2 indices of feature sparse Tensors
      (shape=[number of sparse entries, 2]). Number of sparse entries across all instances
      from the batch. The first value is the index of the instance, the second is
      dimension of the feature. The second axis can only have 2 values, i.e., the
      input dense version of Tensor can only be matrix.
  feature_shape:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. int32; Rank 1 dense shape of feature sparse Tensors
      (shape=[2]). The first axis can only have 2 values, [batch_size, feature_dimension].
  feature_values:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. int32; Rank 1 values of feature sparse Tensors
      (shape=[number of sparse entries]). Number of sparse entries across all instances
      from the batch. The first value is the index of the instance, the second is
      dimension of the feature.
  gradients:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. float32; Rank 2 Tensor (shape=[batch_size, logits_dimension])
      with gradients for each example.
  hessians:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. float32; Rank 2 Tensor (shape=[batch_size, hessian_dimension])
      with hessians for each example.
  max_splits:
    descp: An int that is >= 1. int; the maximum number of splits possible in the
      whole tree.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  node_ids:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. int32; Rank 1 Tensor containing node ids for each
      example, shape [batch_size].
  num_buckets:
    descp: An int that is >= 1. int; equals to the maximum possible value of bucketized
      feature + 1.
