constraints:
  ids:
    descp: A `Tensor` with type `int32` or `int64` containing the ids to be looked
      up in `params`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE with type D_TYPE containing the ids to be looked up in PARAM
  max_norm:
    default: None
    descp: If not `None`, each embedding is clipped if its l2-norm is larger than
      this value.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - If not QSTR each embedding is clipped if its l2 norm is larger than this value
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for the operation BSTR
  params:
    descp: A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor, or a list of
      P tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension, representing sharded
      embedding tensors.  Alternatively, a`PartitionedVariable`, created by partitioning
      along dimension 0. Each element must be appropriately sized for the 'div' `partition_strategy`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A single D_STRUCTURE representing the complete embedding D_STRUCTURE of P D_STRUCTURE
      all of same shape except for the first dimension representing sharded embedding
      D_STRUCTURE
    - Alternatively a QSTR created by partitioning along dimension CONSTANT_NUM
    - Each element must be appropriately sized for the QSTR
exceptions:
- ValueError: If `params` is empty.
