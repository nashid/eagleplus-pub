constraints:
  dt:
    descp: A tf.DType. The type of the tensor to be restored.
  file_pattern:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. Must have a single element. The pattern of the
      files from which we read the tensor.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  preferred_shard:
    default: '-1'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to -1. Index of file to open first if multiple
      files match file_pattern. See the documentation for Restore.
  shape_and_slice:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. Scalar. The shapes and slice specifications to
      use when restoring a tensors.
  tensor_name:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. Must have a single element. The name of the tensor
      to be restored.
