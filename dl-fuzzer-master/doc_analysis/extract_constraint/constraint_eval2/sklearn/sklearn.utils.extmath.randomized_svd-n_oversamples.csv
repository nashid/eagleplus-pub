,int (default is 10) Additional number of random vectors to sample the range of M so as to ensure proper conditioning. The total number of random vectors used to find the range of M is n_components + n_oversamples. Smaller number can improve speed but can negatively impact the quality of approximation of singular vectors and singular values.,10,prim_dtype,dtype(int),,1
