constraints:
  class_weight:
    descp: dict, 'balanced' or None If 'balanced', class weights will be given by
      ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``. If a dictionary is given, keys
      are classes and values are corresponding class weights. If None is given, the
      class weights will be uniform.
    dtype:
    - numeric
  classes:
    descp: ndarray Array of the classes occurring in the data, as given by ``np.unique(y_org)``
      with ``y_org`` the original class labels.
  y:
    descp: array-like, shape (n_samples,) Array of original class labels per sample;
inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - class_weight
  - classes
  - y
