constraints:
  inputs:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects. A list of tensors that will be provided using
      the infeed mechanism.
    structure:
    - list(tf.tensor)
  layouts:
    default: '[]'
    descp: An optional list of ints. Defaults to []. A vector holding the requested
      layout in minor-to-major sequence for all the tuple shapes in the order the
      shapes appear in the "shapes" input. The layout elements for a sub-shape can
      be set to -1 in which case the corresponding layout will be computed by the
      infeed operation.

    - int
    ndim:
    - '1'
    structure:
    - list(int)
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  shapes:
    descp: A list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints). The shapes of
      each tensor in inputs.
