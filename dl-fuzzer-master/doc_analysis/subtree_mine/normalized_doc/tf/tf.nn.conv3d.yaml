    descp: 'A `string` from: `"SAME", "VALID"`. The type of padding algorithm to use.'
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE from QSTR
    - The type of padding algorithm to use
  strides:
    descp: A list of `ints` that has length `>= 5`. 1-D tensor of length 5. The stride
      of the sliding window for each dimension of `input`. Must have `strides[0] =
