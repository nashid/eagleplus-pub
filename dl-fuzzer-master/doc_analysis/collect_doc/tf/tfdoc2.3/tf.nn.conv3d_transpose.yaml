constraints:
  data_format:
    default: NDHWC
    descp: A string. 'NDHWC' and 'NCDHW' are supported.
  dilations:
    default: None
    descp: An int or list of ints that has length 1, 3 or 5, defaults to 1. The dilation
      factor for each dimension ofinput. If a single value is given it is replicated
      in the D, H and W dimension. By default the N and C dimensions are set to 1.
      If set to k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element
      on that dimension. The dimension order is determined by the value of data_format,
      see above for details. Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions if a 5-d
      tensor must be 1.
  filters:
    descp: A 5-D Tensor with the same type as input and shape [depth, height, width,
      output_channels, in_channels]. filter's in_channels dimension must match that
      of input.
  input:
    descp: A 5-D Tensor of type float and shape [batch, depth, height, width, in_channels]
      for NDHWC data format or [batch, in_channels, depth, height, width] for NCDHW
      data format.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: Optional name for the returned tensor.
  output_shape:
    descp: A 1-D Tensor representing the output shape of the deconvolution op.
  padding:
    default: SAME
    descp: A string, either 'VALID' or 'SAME'. The padding algorithm. See the "returns"
      section of tf.nn.convolution for details.
  strides:
    descp: An int or list of ints that has length 1, 3 or 5. The stride of the sliding
      window for each dimension of input. If a single value is given it is replicated
      in the D, H and W dimension. By default the N and C dimensions are set to 0.
      The dimension order is determined by the value of data_format, see below for
      details.

  - padding
