constraints:
  a:
    descp: '`Tensor` of type `float32` or `float64`.'
    normalized_descp:
    - D_STRUCTURE of type D_TYPE
  axes:
    descp: Either a scalar `N`, or a list or an `int32` `Tensor` of shape [2, k].
      If axes is a scalar, sum over the last N axes of a and the first N axes of b
      in order. If axes is a list or `Tensor` the first and second row contain the
      set of unique integers specifying axes along which the contraction is computed,
      for `a` and `b`, respectively. The number of axes for `a` and`b` must be equal.
      If `axes=0`, computes the outer product between `a` and`b`.
    normalized_descp:
    - Either a scalar QSTR or a D_STRUCTURE or an D_TYPE D_STRUCTURE of shape BSTR
    - If axes is a scalar sum over the last N axes of a and the first N axes of b
      in order
    - If axes is a D_STRUCTURE the first and second row contain the set of unique
      D_TYPE specifying axes along which the contraction is computed for QSTR respectively
    - The number of axes for QSTR must be equal
    - If axes CONSTANT_NUM computes the outer product between QSTR
  b:
    descp: '`Tensor` with the same type as `a`.'
    normalized_descp:
    - D_STRUCTURE with the same type as QSTR
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for the operation BSTR
exceptions:
- ValueError: If the shapes of `a`, `b`, and `axes` are incompatible.
- IndexError: If the values in axes exceed the rank of the corresponding tensor.
