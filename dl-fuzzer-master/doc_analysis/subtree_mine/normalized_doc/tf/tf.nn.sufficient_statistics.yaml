constraints:
  axes:
    descp: Array of ints. Axes along which to compute mean and variance.
    normalized_descp:
    - D_STRUCTURE of D_TYPE
    - Axes along which to compute mean and variance
  keepdims:
    default: 'False'
    descp: produce statistics with the same dimensionality as the input.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_descp:
    - produce statistics with the same dimensionality as the input
  name:
    default: None
    descp: Name used to scope the operations that compute the sufficient stats.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Name used to scope the operations that compute the sufficient stats
  shift:
    default: None
    descp: A `Tensor` containing the value by which to shift the data for numerical
      stability, or `None` if no shift is to be performed. A shift close to the true
      mean provides the most numerically stable results.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE containing the value by which to shift the data for numerical
      stability, or QSTR if no shift is to be performed
    - A shift close to the CONSTANT_BOOL mean provides the most numerically stable
      results
  x:
    descp: A `Tensor`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE
inputs:
  optional:
  - shift
  - keepdims
  - name
  required:
  - x
