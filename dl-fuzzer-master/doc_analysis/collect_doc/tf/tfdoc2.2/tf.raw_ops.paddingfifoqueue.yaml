constraints:
  capacity:
    default: '-1'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to -1. The upper bound on the number of elements
      in this queue. Negative numbers mean no limit.
  component_types:
    descp: A list of tf.DTypes that has length >= 1. The type of each component in
      a value.
  container:
    default: ''
    descp: An optional string. Defaults to "". If non-empty, this queue is placed
      in the given container. Otherwise, a default container is used.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  shapes:
    default: '[]'
    descp: An optional list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints). Defaults
      to []. The shape of each component in a value. The length of this attr must
      be either 0 or the same as the length of component_types. Shapes of fixed rank
      but variable size are allowed by setting any shape dimension to -1. In this
      case, the inputs' shape may vary along the given dimension, and DequeueMany
      will pad the given dimension with zeros up to the maximum shape of all elements
      in the given batch. If the length of this attr is 0, different queue elements
      may have different ranks and shapes, but only one element may be dequeued at
      a time.
  shared_name:
    default: ''
    descp: An optional string. Defaults to "". If non-empty, this queue will be shared
      under the given name across multiple sessions.
inputs:
  optional:
  - shapes
  - capacity
  - container
  - shared_name
  - name
  required:
  - component_types
