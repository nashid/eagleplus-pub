constraints:
  client_terminated:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. If set to true, this indicates that
      the node was added to the graph as a result of a client-side feed or fetch of
      Tensor data, in which case the corresponding send or recv is expected to be
      managed locally by the caller.

  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).

  recv_device:
    descp: A string. The name of the device receiving the tensor.

  send_device:
    descp: A string. The name of the device sending the tensor.

  send_device_incarnation:
    descp: An int. The current incarnation of send_device.

  tensor:
    descp: A Tensor. The tensor to send.
