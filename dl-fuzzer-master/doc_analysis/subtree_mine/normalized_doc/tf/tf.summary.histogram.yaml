constraints:
  buckets:
    default: None
    descp: Optional positive `int`. The output will have this many buckets, except
      in two edge cases. If there is no data, then there are no buckets. If there
      is data but all points have the same value, then there is one bucket whose left
      and right endpoints are the same.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Optional positive D_TYPE
    - The output will have this many buckets, except in two edge cases
    - If there is no PARAM, then there are no buckets
    - If there is PARAM but all points have the same value, then there is one bucket
      whose left and right endpoints are the same
  data:
    descp: A `Tensor` of any shape. Must be castable to `float64`.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE of any shape
    - Must be castable to D_TYPE
  description:
    default: None
    descp: Optional long-form description for this summary, as a constant `str`. Markdown
      is supported. Defaults to empty.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Optional long form description for this summary, as a constant D_TYPE
    - Markdown is supported
    - Defaults to empty
  name:
    descp: A name for this summary. The summary tag used for TensorBoard will be this
      name prefixed by any active name scopes.
    normalized_descp:
    - A name for this summary
    - The summary tag used for TensorBoard will be this name prefixed by any active
      name scopes
  step:
    default: None
    descp: Explicit `int64`-castable monotonic step value for this summary. If omitted,
      this defaults to `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`, which must not be None.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - Explicit D_TYPE castable monotonic step value for this summary
    - If omitted, this defaults to tf summary experimental get_step , which must not
      be None
exceptions:
- ValueError: if a default writer exists, but no step was provided and`tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`
    is None.
