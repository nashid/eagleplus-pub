constraints:
  dilations:
    default: '[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]'
    descp: An optional list of ints. Defaults to [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
  filter:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as input. Shape [depth, rows, cols, in_channels,
      out_channels]. in_channels must match between input and filter.
  input:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, float32, float64.
      Shape [batch, depth, rows, cols, in_channels].'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  out_backprop:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as input. Backprop signal of shape [batch,
      out_depth, out_rows, out_cols, out_channels].
  padding:
    descp: 'A string from: "SAME", "VALID". The type of padding algorithm to use.'
  strides:
    descp: A list of ints that has length >= 5. 1-D tensor of length 5. The stride
      of the sliding window for each dimension of input. Must have strides[0] = strides[4]
      = 1.
inputs:
  optional:
  - dilations
  - name
  required:
  - input
  - filter
  - out_backprop
  - strides
  - padding
