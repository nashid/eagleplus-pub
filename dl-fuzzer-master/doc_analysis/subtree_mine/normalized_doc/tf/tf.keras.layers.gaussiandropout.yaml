aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.keras.layers.GaussianDropout
constraints:
  '**kwargs':
    default: null
    descp: ''
    normalized_descp: []
  rate:
    descp: Float, drop probability (as with `Dropout`). The multiplicative noise will
      have standard deviation `sqrt(rate / (1 - rate))`.
    normalized_descp:
    - D_TYPE, drop probability as with QSTR
    - The multiplicative noise will have standard deviation sqrt BSTR
inputs:
  optional:
  - '**kwargs'
  required:
  - rate
