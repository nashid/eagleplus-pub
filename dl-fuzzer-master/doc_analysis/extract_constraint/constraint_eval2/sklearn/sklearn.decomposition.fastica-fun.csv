,"string or function, optional. Default: 'logcosh' The functional form of the G function used in the approximation to neg-entropy. Could be either 'logcosh', 'exp', or 'cube'. You can also provide your own function. It should return a tuple containing the value of the function, and of its derivative, in the point. The derivative should be averaged along its last dimension. Example: def my_g(x): return x ** 3, np.mean(3 * x ** 2, axis=-1)",logcosh,prim_dtype,dtype(string),,1
