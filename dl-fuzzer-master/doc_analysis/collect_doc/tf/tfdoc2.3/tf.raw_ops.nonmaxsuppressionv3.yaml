constraints:
  boxes:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, float32. A 2-D float
      tensor of shape [num_boxes, 4].'
  iou_threshold:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, float32. A 0-D float
      tensor representing the threshold for deciding whether boxes overlap too much
      with respect to IOU.'
  max_output_size:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. A scalar integer tensor representing the maximum
      number of boxes to be selected by non max suppression.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  score_threshold:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as iou_threshold. A 0-D float tensor
      representing the threshold for deciding when to remove boxes based on score.
  scores:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as boxes. A 1-D float tensor of shape
      [num_boxes] representing a single score corresponding to each box (each row
      of boxes).
