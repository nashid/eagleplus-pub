aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.keras.layers.GaussianDropout
constraints:
  '**kwargs':
    descp: ''
  rate:
    descp: Float, drop probability (as with Dropout). The multiplicative noise will
      have standard deviation sqrt(rate / (1 - rate)).
inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - rate
  - '**kwargs'
