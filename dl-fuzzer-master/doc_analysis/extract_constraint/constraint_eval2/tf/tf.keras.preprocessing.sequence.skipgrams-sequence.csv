,"A word sequence (sentence), encoded as a list     of word indices (integers). If using a `sampling_table`,     word indices are expected to match the rank     of the words in a reference dataset (e.g. 10 would encode     the 10-th most frequently occurring token).     Note that index 0 is expected to be a non-word and will be skipped.",,nonprim_dtype,structure(list),,1
