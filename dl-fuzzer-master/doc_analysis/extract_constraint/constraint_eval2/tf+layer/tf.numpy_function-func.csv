,"A Python function, which accepts `numpy.ndarray` objects as arguments and returns a list of `numpy.ndarray` objects (or a single`numpy.ndarray`). This function must accept as many arguments as there are tensors in `inp`, and these argument types will match the corresponding`tf.Tensor` objects in `inp`. The returns `numpy.ndarray`s must match the number and types defined `Tout`. Important Note: Input and output `numpy.ndarray`s of `func` are not guaranteed to be copies. In some cases their underlying memory will be shared with the corresponding TensorFlow tensors. In-place modification or storing `func` input or return values in python datastructures without explicit (np.)copy can have non-deterministic consequences.",,,,0,0
