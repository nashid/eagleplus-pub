constraints:
  input:
    descp: A Tensor. The input tensor to be padded.
  mode:
    descp: 'A string from: "REFLECT", "SYMMETRIC". Either REFLECT or SYMMETRIC. In
      reflect mode the padded regions do not include the borders, while in symmetric
      mode the padded regions do include the borders. For example, if input is [1,
      2, 3] and paddings is [0, 2], then the output is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] in reflect
      mode, and it is [1, 2, 3, 3, 2] in symmetric mode.'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  paddings:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. A two-column
      matrix specifying the padding sizes. The number of rows must be the same as
      the rank of input.'
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - input
  - paddings
  - mode
