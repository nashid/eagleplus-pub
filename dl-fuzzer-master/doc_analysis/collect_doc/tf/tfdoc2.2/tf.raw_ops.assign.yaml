constraints:
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  ref:
    descp: A mutable Tensor. Should be from a Variable node. May be uninitialized.
  use_locking:
    default: 'True'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to True. If True, the assignment will be protected
      by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.
  validate_shape:
    default: 'True'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to True. If true, the operation will validate
      that the shape of 'value' matches the shape of the Tensor being assigned to.
      If false, 'ref' will take on the shape of 'value'.
  value:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as ref. The value to be assigned to the
      variable.
inputs:
  optional:
  - validate_shape
  - use_locking
  - name
  required:
  - ref
