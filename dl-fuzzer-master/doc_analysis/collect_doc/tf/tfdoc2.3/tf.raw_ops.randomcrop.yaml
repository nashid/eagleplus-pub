constraints:
  image:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: uint8, int8, int16, int32,
      int64, float32, float64. 3-D of shape [height, width, channels].'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  seed:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. If either seed or seed2 are set to be non-zero,
      the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, it is seeded
      by a random seed.
  seed2:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. An second seed to avoid seed collision.
  size:
    descp: 'A Tensor of type int64. 1-D of length 2 containing: crop_height, crop_width..'
inputs:
  optional:
  - seed
  - seed2
  - name
  required:
  - image
  - size
