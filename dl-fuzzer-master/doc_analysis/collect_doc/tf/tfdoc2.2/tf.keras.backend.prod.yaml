aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.keras.backend.prod
constraints:
  axis:
    default: None
    descp: An integer, the axis to compute the product.
  keepdims:
    default: 'False'
    descp: A boolean, whether to keep the dimensions or not. If keepdims is False,
      the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1. If keepdims is True, the reduced dimension
      is retained with length 1.
  x:
    descp: A tensor or variable.
inputs:
  optional:
  - axis
  - keepdims
  required:
  - x

outputs:
- A tensor with the product of elements of x.
