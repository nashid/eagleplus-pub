constraints:
  deleter:
    descp: A Tensor of type variant. A variant deleter.
    dtype:
    - tf.variant
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  iterators:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects with type resource. A list of iterator handles
      (unused). This is added so that automatic control dependencies get added during
      function tracing that ensure this op runs after all the dependent iterators
      are deleted.
    structure:
    - list
    - list(tf.tensor)
  multi_device_iterator:
    descp: A Tensor of type resource. A handle to the multi device iterator to delete.
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - multi_device_iterator
  - iterators
