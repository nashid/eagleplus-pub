constraints:
  buffer_size:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. A scalar representing the number of bytes to buffer.
      A value of 0 means no buffering will be performed.
  compression_type:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. A scalar containing either (i) the empty string
      (no compression), (ii) "ZLIB", or (iii) "GZIP".
  filenames:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. A scalar or vector containing the name(s) of the
      file(s) to be read.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
