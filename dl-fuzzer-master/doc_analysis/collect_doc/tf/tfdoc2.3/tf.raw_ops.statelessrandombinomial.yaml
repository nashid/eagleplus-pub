constraints:
  counts:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, float32, float64,
      int32, int64. The counts of the binomial distribution. Must be broadcastable
      with probs, and broadcastable with the rightmost dimensions of shape.'
  dtype:

    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  probs:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as counts. The probability of success
      for the binomial distribution. Must be broadcastable with counts and broadcastable
      with the rightmost dimensions of shape.

      of the output tensor.'
