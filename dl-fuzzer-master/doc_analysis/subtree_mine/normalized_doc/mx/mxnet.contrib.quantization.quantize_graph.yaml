    descp: If calib_mode='none', no calibration will be used and the thresholds for
      requantization after the corresponding layers will be calculated at runtime
      by calling min and max operators. The quantized models generated in this mode
      are normally 10-20% slower than those with calibrations during inference. If
      calib_mode='naive', the min and max values of the layer outputs from a calibration
      dataset will be directly taken as the thresholds for quantization. If calib_mode='entropy'
      (default mode), the thresholds for quantization will be derived such that the
      KL divergence between the distributions of FP32 layer outputs and quantized
      layer outputs is minimized based upon the calibration dataset.
