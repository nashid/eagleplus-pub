constraints:
  alpha:
    default: '0.2'
    descp: An optional float. Defaults to 0.2.
  features:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as gradients. The features passed as
      input to the corresponding LeakyRelu operation, OR the outputs of that operation
      (both work equivalently).
  gradients:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, bfloat16, float32,
      float64. The backpropagated gradients to the corresponding LeakyRelu operation.'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
inputs:
  optional:
  - alpha
  - name
  required:
  - gradients
  - features
