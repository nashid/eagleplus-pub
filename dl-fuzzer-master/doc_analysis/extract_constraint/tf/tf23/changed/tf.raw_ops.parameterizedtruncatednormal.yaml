constraints:
  maxvals:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as means. The maximum cutoff. May be
      +infinity, and must be more than the minval for each batch.
    dtype:
    - dtype:&means
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  means:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, bfloat16, float32,
      float64. The mean parameter of each batch.'
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  minvals:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as means. The minimum cutoff. May be
      -infinity.
    dtype:
    - dtype:&means
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  seed:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 0. If either seed or seed2 are set to be non-zero,
      the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, it is seeded
      by a random seed.

    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. The shape
      of the output tensor. Batches are indexed by the 0th dimension.'

    range:
    - '[0,inf)'
    tensor_t:

  stdevs:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as means. The standard deviation parameter
      of each batch. Must be greater than 0.
