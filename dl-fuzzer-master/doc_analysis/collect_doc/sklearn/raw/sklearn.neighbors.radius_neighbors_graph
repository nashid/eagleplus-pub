sklearn.neighbors.radius_neighbors_graph = radius_neighbors_graph(X, radius, mode='connectivity', metric='minkowski', p=2, metric_params=None, include_self=False, n_jobs=None)
    Computes the (weighted) graph of Neighbors for points in X
    
    Neighborhoods are restricted the points at a distance lower than
    radius.
    
    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <unsupervised_neighbors>`.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features) or BallTree
        Sample data, in the form of a numpy array or a precomputed
        :class:`BallTree`.
    
    radius : float
        Radius of neighborhoods.
    
    mode : {'connectivity', 'distance'}, optional
        Type of returned matrix: 'connectivity' will return the connectivity
        matrix with ones and zeros, and 'distance' will return the distances
        between neighbors according to the given metric.
    
    metric : string, default 'minkowski'
        The distance metric used to calculate the neighbors within a
        given radius for each sample point. The DistanceMetric class
        gives a list of available metrics. The default distance is
        'euclidean' ('minkowski' metric with the param equal to 2.)
    
    p : int, default 2
        Power parameter for the Minkowski metric. When p = 1, this is
        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.
    
    metric_params : dict, optional
        additional keyword arguments for the metric function.
    
    include_self : bool or 'auto', default=False
        Whether or not to mark each sample as the first nearest neighbor to
        itself. If 'auto', then True is used for mode='connectivity' and False
        for mode='distance'.
    
    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.
    
    Returns
    -------
    A : sparse graph in CSR format, shape = [n_samples, n_samples]
        A[i, j] is assigned the weight of edge that connects i to j.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> X = [[0], [3], [1]]
    >>> from sklearn.neighbors import radius_neighbors_graph
    >>> A = radius_neighbors_graph(X, 1.5, mode='connectivity',
    ...                            include_self=True)
    >>> A.toarray()
    array([[1., 0., 1.],
           [0., 1., 0.],
           [1., 0., 1.]])
