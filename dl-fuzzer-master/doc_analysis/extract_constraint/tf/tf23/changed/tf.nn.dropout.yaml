constraints:
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for this operation (optional).
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  noise_shape:
    default: None
    descp: A 1-D Tensor of type int32, representing the shape for randomly generated
      keep/drop flags.
    dtype:
    - tf.int32
    ndim:
    - '1'
    range:
    - '[0,inf)'
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  rate:
    descp: A scalar Tensor with the same type as x. The probability that each element
      is dropped. For example, setting rate=0.1 would drop 10% of input elements.
    dtype:
    - dtype:&x
    ndim:
    - '0'
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  seed:
    default: None
    descp: A Python integer. Used to create random seeds. See tf.random.set_seed for
      behavior.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
  x:
    descp: A floating point tensor.
    dtype:
    - float
    ndim:
    - '0'
exceptions:
- ValueError: If rate is not in [0, 1) or if x is not a floating point tensor. rate=1
    is disallowed, because the output would be all zeros, which is likely not what
    was intended.
inputs:
  optional:
  - noise_shape
  - seed
  - name
  required:
  - x
  - rate
