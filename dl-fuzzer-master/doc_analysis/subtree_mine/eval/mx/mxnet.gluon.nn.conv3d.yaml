  groups:
    default: '1'
    descp: Controls the connections between inputs and outputs. At groups=1, all inputs
      are convolved to all outputs. At groups=2, the operation becomes equivalent
      to having two conv layers side by side, each seeing half the input channels,
      and producing half the output channels, and both subsequently concatenated.
