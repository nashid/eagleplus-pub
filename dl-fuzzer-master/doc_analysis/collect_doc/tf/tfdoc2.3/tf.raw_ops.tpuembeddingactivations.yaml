constraints:
  embedding_variable:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. A trainable variable, enabling optimizers to
      find this op.
  lookup_id:
    descp: An int that is >= 0. Identifier of the set of embedding indices which produced
      these activations.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  sliced_activations:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. The embedding activations Tensor to return.
  table_id:
    descp: An int that is >= 0. The id of the table in the embedding layer configuration
      from which these activations were computed.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - embedding_variable
  - sliced_activations
