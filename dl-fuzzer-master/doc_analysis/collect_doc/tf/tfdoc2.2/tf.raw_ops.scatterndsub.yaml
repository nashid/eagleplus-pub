constraints:
  indices:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. A Tensor.
      Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. A tensor of indices into ref.'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  ref:
    descp: 'A mutable Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64,
      int32, uint8, int16, int8, complex64, int64, qint8, quint8, qint32, bfloat16,
      uint16, complex128, half, uint32, uint64. A mutable Tensor. Should be from a
      Variable node.'
  updates:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as ref. A Tensor. Must have the same
      type as ref. A tensor of updated values to subtract from ref.
  use_locking:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to False. An optional bool. Defaults to True.
      If True, the assignment will be protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior
      is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.
inputs:
  optional:
  - use_locking
  - name
  required:
  - ref
