constraints:
  buffer_size:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. The number of output elements to buffer in an iterator
      over this dataset. Compare with the min_after_dequeue attr when creating a RandomShuffleQueue.
  input_dataset:
    descp: A Tensor of type variant.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_shapes:
    descp: A list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints) that has length
      >= 1.
  output_types:
    descp: A list of tf.DTypes that has length >= 1.
  reshuffle_each_iteration:
    default: 'True'
    descp: An optional bool. Defaults to True. If true, each iterator over this dataset
      will be given a different pseudorandomly generated seed, based on a sequence
      seeded by the seed and seed2 inputs. If false, each iterator will be given the
      same seed, and repeated iteration over this dataset will yield the exact same
      sequence of results.
  seed:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. A scalar seed for the random number generator.
      If either seed or seed2 is set to be non-zero, the random number generator is
      seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, a random seed is used.
  seed2:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. A second scalar seed to avoid seed collision.
inputs:
  optional:
  - reshuffle_each_iteration
  - name
  required:
  - input_dataset
  - buffer_size
  - seed
  - seed2
  - output_types
  - output_shapes
