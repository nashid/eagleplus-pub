    default: None
    descp: A name for this operation (optional). Defaults to "assert_rank_at_least".
  rank:
    descp: Scalar integer Tensor.
  x:
    descp: Tensor.
exceptions:
- InvalidArgumentError: x does not have rank at least rank, but the rank cannot be
    statically determined.
- ValueError: If static checks determine x has mismatched rank.
inputs:
  optional:
  - message
  - name
  required:
  - x
  - rank

outputs:
- Op raising InvalidArgumentError unless x has specified rank or higher. If static
  checks determine x has correct rank, a no_op is returned. This can be used with
  tf.control_dependencies inside of tf.functions to block followup computation until
  the check has executed.
