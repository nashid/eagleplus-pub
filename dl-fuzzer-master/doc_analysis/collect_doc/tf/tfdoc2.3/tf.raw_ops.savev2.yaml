constraints:
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  prefix:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. Must have a single element. The prefix of the
      V2 checkpoint to which we write the tensors.
  shape_and_slices:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. shape {N}. The slice specs of the tensors to be
      saved. Empty strings indicate that they are non-partitioned tensors.
  tensor_names:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. shape {N}. The names of the tensors to be saved.
  tensors:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects. N tensors to save.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - prefix
  - tensor_names
  - shape_and_slices
