constraints:
  X:
    descp: array, shape (n_samples, n_features) feature matrix representing n_samples
      samples to be clustered
  connectivity:
    default: None
    descp: sparse matrix (optional). connectivity matrix. Defines for each sample
      the neighboring samples following a given structure of the data. The matrix
      is assumed to be symmetric and only the upper triangular half is used. Default
      is None, i.e, the Ward algorithm is unstructured.
  n_clusters:
    default: None
    descp: int (optional) Stop early the construction of the tree at n_clusters. This
      is useful to decrease computation time if the number of clusters is not small
      compared to the number of samples. In this case, the complete tree is not computed,
      thus the 'children' output is of limited use, and the 'parents' output should
      rather be used. This option is valid only when specifying a connectivity matrix.
    dtype:
    - int
  return_distance:
    default: 'False'
    descp: bool (optional) If True, return the distance between the clusters.
    dtype:
    - boolean
    ndim:
    - '0'
inputs:
  optional:
  - connectivity
  - n_clusters
  - return_distance
