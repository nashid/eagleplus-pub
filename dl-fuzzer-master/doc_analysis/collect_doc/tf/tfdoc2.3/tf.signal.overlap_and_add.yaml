aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.signal.overlap_and_add
constraints:
  frame_step:
    descp: An integer or scalar Tensor denoting overlap offsets. Must be less than
      or equal to frame_length.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: An optional name for the operation.
  signal:
    descp: A [..., frames, frame_length] Tensor. All dimensions may be unknown, and
      rank must be at least 2.
exceptions:
- ValueError: If signal's rank is less than 2, or frame_step is not a scalar integer.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - signal
  - frame_step

outputs:
- A Tensor with shape [..., output_size] containing the overlap-added frames of signal's
  inner-most two dimensions.
