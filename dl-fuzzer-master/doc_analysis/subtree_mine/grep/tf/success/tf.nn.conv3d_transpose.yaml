constraints:
  data_format:
    default: NDHWC
    descp: A string. 'NDHWC' and 'NCDHW' are supported.
    dtype:
    - tf.string
  dilations:
    default: None
    descp: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `3` or `5`, defaults to 1.
      The dilation factor for each dimension of`input`. If a single value is given
      it is replicated in the `D`, `H` and `W` dimension. By default the `N` and `C`
      dimensions are set to 1. If set to k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between
      each filter element on that dimension. The dimension order is determined by
      the value of `data_format`, see above for details. Dilations in the batch and
      depth dimensions if a 5-d tensor must be 1.
    dtype:
    - int
    structure:
    - list
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  filters:
    descp: A 5-D `Tensor` with the same type as `value` and shape `[height, width,
      output_channels, in_channels]`.  `filter`'s `in_channels` dimension must match
      that of `value`.
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  input:
    descp: A 5-D `Tensor` of type `float` and shape `[batch, height, width, in_channels]`
      for `NHWC` data format or `[batch, in_channels, height, width]` for `NCHW` data
      format.
    dtype:
    - float
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  name:
    default: None
    descp: Optional name for the returned tensor.
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  output_shape:
    descp: A 1-D `Tensor` representing the output shape of the deconvolution op.
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  padding:
    default: SAME
    descp: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm. See the
      "returns" section of `tf.nn.convolution` for details.
    dtype:
    - tf.string
  strides:
    descp: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `3` or `5`.  The stride of
      the sliding window for each dimension of `input`. If a single value is given
      it is replicated in the `D`, `H` and `W` dimension. By default the `N` and `C`
      dimensions are set to 0. The dimension order is determined by the value of `data_format`,
      see below for details.
    dtype:
    - int

  optional:
  - padding
  - data_format
  - dilations
  - name
  required:
  - input
