"str, Backend","The backend to use. Depending on build-time configurations, valid values include `mpi`, `gloo`, and `nccl`. This field should be given as a lowercase string (e.g., `""gloo""`), which can also be accessed via `Backend` attributes (e.g., `Backend.GLOO`). If using multiple processes per machine with `nccl` backend, each process must have exclusive access to every GPU it uses, as sharing GPUs between processes can result in deadlocks.",,prim_dtype,dtype(string),,1
