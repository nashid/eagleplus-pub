constraints:
  axis:
    default: None
    descp: An integer, the axis to find minimum values.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - An D_TYPE the axis to find minimum values
  keepdims:
    default: 'False'
    descp: A boolean, whether to keep the dimensions or not. If `keepdims` is `False`,
      the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1. If `keepdims` is `True`, the reduced
      dimension is retained with length 1.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_TYPE whether to keep the dimensions or not
    - If QSTR is CONSTANT_BOOL the rank of the D_STRUCTURE is reduced by CONSTANT_NUM
    - If QSTR is CONSTANT_BOOL the reduced dimension is retained with length CONSTANT_NUM
  x:
    descp: A tensor or variable.
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE or variable
