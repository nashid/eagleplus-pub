aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.math.unsorted_segment_mean
- tf.compat.v1.unsorted_segment_mean
constraints:
  data:
    descp: A Tensor with floating point or complex dtype.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  num_segments:
    descp: An integer scalar Tensor. The number of distinct segment IDs.
  segment_ids:
    descp: An integer tensor whose shape is a prefix of data.shape.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - data
  - segment_ids
  - num_segments
link: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/math/unsorted_segment_mean
outputs:
- A Tensor. Has same shape as data, except for the first segment_ids.rank dimensions,
  which are replaced with a single dimension which has size num_segments.
