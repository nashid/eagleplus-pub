constraints:
  block_size:
    descp: An int that is >= 2.
  crops:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. 2-D tensor
      of non-negative integers with shape [2, 2]. It specifies how many elements to
      crop from the intermediate result across the spatial dimensions as follows:
      crops = [[crop_top, crop_bottom], [crop_left, crop_right]]'
  input:
    descp: A Tensor. 4-D tensor with shape [batch*block_size*block_size, height_pad/block_size,
      width_pad/block_size, depth]. Note that the batch size of the input tensor must
      be divisible by block_size * block_size.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
