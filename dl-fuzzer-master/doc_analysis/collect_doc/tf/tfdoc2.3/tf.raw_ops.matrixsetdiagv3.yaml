constraints:
  align:
    default: RIGHT_LEFT
    descp: 'An optional string from: "LEFT_RIGHT", "RIGHT_LEFT", "LEFT_LEFT", "RIGHT_RIGHT".
      Defaults to "RIGHT_LEFT". Some diagonals are shorter than max_diag_len and need
      to be padded. align is a string specifying how superdiagonals and subdiagonals
      should be aligned, respectively. There are four possible alignments: "RIGHT_LEFT"
      (default), "LEFT_RIGHT", "LEFT_LEFT", and "RIGHT_RIGHT". "RIGHT_LEFT" aligns
      superdiagonals to the right (left-pads the row) and subdiagonals to the left
      (right-pads the row). It is the packing format LAPACK uses. cuSPARSE uses "LEFT_RIGHT",
      which is the opposite alignment.'
  diagonal:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as input. Rank r when k is an integer
      or k[0] == k[1]. Otherwise, it has rank r+1. k >= 1.
  input:
    descp: A Tensor. Rank r+1, where r >= 1.
  k:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. Diagonal offset(s). Positive value means superdiagonal,
      0 refers to the main diagonal, and negative value means subdiagonals. k can
      be a single integer (for a single diagonal) or a pair of integers specifying
      the low and high ends of a matrix band. k[0] must not be larger than k[1].
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
