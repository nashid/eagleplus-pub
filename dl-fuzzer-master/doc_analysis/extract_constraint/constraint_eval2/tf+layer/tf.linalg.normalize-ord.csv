,"Order of the norm. Supported values are `'fro'`, `'euclidean'`, `1`,`2`, `np.inf` and any positive real number yielding the corresponding p-norm. Default is `'euclidean'` which is equivalent to Frobenius norm if`tensor` is a matrix and equivalent to 2-norm for vectors. Some restrictions apply: a) The Frobenius norm `'fro'` is not defined for vectors, b) If axis is a 2-tuple (matrix norm), only `'euclidean'`, '`fro'`, `1`, `2`, `np.inf` are supported.
