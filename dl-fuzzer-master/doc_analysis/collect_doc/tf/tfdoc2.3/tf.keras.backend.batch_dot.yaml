constraints:
  axes:
    default: None
    descp: Tuple or list of integers with target dimensions, or single integer. The
      sizes of x.shape[axes[0]] and y.shape[axes[1]] should be equal.
  x:
    descp: Keras tensor or variable with ndim >= 2.
  y:
    descp: Keras tensor or variable with ndim >= 2.
inputs:
  optional:
  - axes
  required:
  - x
  - y

outputs:
- A tensor with shape equal to the concatenation of x's shape (less the dimension
  that was summed over) and y's shape (less the batch dimension and the dimension
  that was summed over). If the final rank is 1, we reshape it to (batch_size, 1).
