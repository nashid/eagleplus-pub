constraints:
  graph_def:
    descp: A `GraphDef` proto containing operations to be imported into the default
      graph.
    normalized_descp:
    - A QSTR proto containing operations to be imported into the default graph
  input_map:
    default: None
    descp: A dictionary mapping input names (as strings) in `graph_def`to `Tensor`
      objects. The values of the named input tensors in the imported graph will be
      re-mapped to the respective `Tensor` values.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE mapping input names BSTR in PARAMto D_STRUCTURE objects
    - The values of the named input D_STRUCTURE in the imported graph will be re mapped
      to the respective D_STRUCTURE values
  name:
    default: None
    descp: (Optional.) A prefix that will be prepended to the names in`graph_def`.
      Note that this does not apply to imported function names. Defaults to `"import"`.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - ONE_WORD BSTR
    - A prefix that will be prepended to the names in PARAM
    - Note that this does not apply to imported function names
    - Defaults to QSTR
  op_dict:
    default: None
    descp: (Optional.) Deprecated, do not use.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - ONE_WORD BSTR
    - Deprecated, do not use
  producer_op_list:
    default: None
    descp: (Optional.) An `OpList` proto with the (possibly stripped) list of `OpDef`s
      used by the producer of the graph. If provided, unrecognized attrs for ops in
      `graph_def` that have their default value according to `producer_op_list` will
      be removed. This will allow some more`GraphDef`s produced by later binaries
      to be accepted by earlier binaries.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - ONE_WORD BSTR
    - An QSTR proto with the BSTR D_STRUCTURE of QSTR used by the producer of the
      graph
    - If provided, unrecognized attrs for ops in PARAM that have their default value
      according to QSTR will be removed
    - This will allow some more QSTR produced by later binaries to be accepted by
      earlier binaries
  return_elements:
    default: None
    descp: A list of strings containing operation names in`graph_def` that will be
      returned as `Operation` objects; and/or tensor names in `graph_def` that will
      be returned as `Tensor` objects.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT None
    normalized_descp:
    - A D_STRUCTURE of D_TYPE containing operation names in PARAM that will be returned
      as QSTR objects and or D_STRUCTURE names in PARAM that will be returned as D_STRUCTURE
      objects
exceptions:
- TypeError: If `graph_def` is not a `GraphDef` proto,`input_map` is not a dictionary
    mapping strings to `Tensor` objects, or `return_elements` is not a list of strings.
- ValueError: If `input_map`, or `return_elements` contains names that do not appear
    in `graph_def`, or `graph_def` is not well-formed (e.g. it refers to an unknown
    tensor).
