constraints:
  dimension_ids:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects with type int32. List of rank 1 tensors representing
      the dimension in each feature.
  feature_ids:
    descp: A list of at least 1 Tensor objects with type int32. Rank 1 tensor with
      ids for each feature. This is the real id of the feature that will be used in
      the split.
  gains:
    descp: A list with the same length as dimension_ids of Tensor objects with type
      float32. List of rank 1 tensors representing the gains for each of the feature's
      split.
  learning_rate:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. shrinkage const for each new tree.
  left_node_contribs:
    descp: A list with the same length as dimension_ids of Tensor objects with type
      float32. List of rank 2 tensors with left leaf contribs for each of the feature's
      splits. Will be added to the previous node values to constitute the values of
      the left nodes.
  logits_dimension:
    default: '1'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to 1. scalar, dimension of the logits
  max_depth:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. Max depth of the tree to build.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  node_ids:
    descp: A list with the same length as dimension_ids of Tensor objects with type
      int32. List of rank 1 tensors representing the nodes for which this feature
      has a split.
  pruning_mode:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. 0-No pruning, 1-Pre-pruning, 2-Post-pruning.
  right_node_contribs:
    descp: A list with the same length as dimension_ids of Tensor objects with type
      float32. List of rank 2 tensors with right leaf contribs for each of the feature's
      splits. Will be added to the previous node values to constitute the values of
      the right nodes.
  split_types:
    descp: A list with the same length as dimension_ids of Tensor objects with type
      string. List of rank 1 tensors representing the split type for each feature.
  thresholds:
    descp: A list with the same length as dimension_ids of Tensor objects with type
      int32. List of rank 1 tensors representing the thesholds for each of the feature's
      split.
  tree_ensemble_handle:
    descp: A Tensor of type resource. Handle to the ensemble variable.
