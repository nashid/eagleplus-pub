constraints:
  aggregation_weights:
    descp: 'A list with the same length as sample_indices of Tensor objects with the
      same type in: float32, float64. A list of rank 1 Tensors containing per sample
      -- i.e. per (training example, feature) -- aggregation weights.'
  combiners:
    default: '[]'
    descp: An optional list of strings. Defaults to []. A list of string scalars,
      one for each embedding table that specify how to normalize the embedding activations
      after weighted summation. Supported combiners are 'mean', 'sum', or 'sqrtn'.
      It is invalid to have the sum of the weights be 0 for 'mean' or the sum of the
      squared weights be 0 for 'sqrtn'. If combiners isn't passed, the default is
      to use 'sum' for all tables.
  device_ordinal:
    default: '-1'
    descp: An optional int. Defaults to -1. The TPU device to use. Should be >= 0
      and less than the number of TPU cores in the task on which the node is placed.
  embedding_indices:
    descp: 'A list with the same length as sample_indices of Tensor objects with the
      same type in: int32, int64. A list of rank 1 Tensors, indices into the embedding
      tables.'
  mode_override:
    descp: A Tensor of type string. A string input that overrides the mode specified
      in the TPUEmbeddingConfiguration. Supported values are {'unspecified', 'inference',
      'training', 'backward_pass_only'}. When set to 'unspecified', the mode set in
      TPUEmbeddingConfiguration is used, otherwise mode_override is used.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  sample_indices:
    descp: 'A list of at least 1 Tensor objects with the same type in: int32, int64.
      A list of rank 1 Tensors specifying the training example and feature to which
      the corresponding embedding_indices and aggregation_weights values belong. sample_indices[i]
      must equal b * nf + f, where nf is the number of features from the corresponding
      table, f is in [0, nf), and b is in [0, batch size).'
inputs:
  optional:
  - device_ordinal
  - combiners
  - name
  required:
  - sample_indices
  - embedding_indices
