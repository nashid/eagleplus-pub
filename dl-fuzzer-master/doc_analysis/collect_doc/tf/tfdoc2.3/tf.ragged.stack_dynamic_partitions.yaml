aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.ragged.stack_dynamic_partitions
constraints:
  data:
    descp: A Tensor or RaggedTensor containing the values to stack.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name prefix for the returned tensor (optional).
  num_partitions:
    descp: An int32 or int64 scalar specifying the number of partitions to output.
      This determines the number of rows in output.
  partitions:
    descp: An int32 or int64 Tensor or RaggedTensor specifying the partition that
      each slice of data should be added to. partitions.shape must be a prefix of
      data.shape. Values must be greater than or equal to zero, and less than num_partitions.
      partitions is not required to be sorted.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - data
  - partitions
  - num_partitions

outputs:
- A RaggedTensor containing the stacked partitions. The returned tensor has the same
  dtype as data, and its shape is [num_partitions, (D)] + data.shape[partitions.rank:],
  where (D) is a ragged dimension whose length is the number of data slices stacked
  for each partition.
