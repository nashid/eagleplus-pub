aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.nest.flatten
constraints:
  expand_composites:
    default: 'False'
    descp: If true, then composite tensors such as tf.SparseTensor and tf.RaggedTensor
      are expanded into their component tensors.
    normalized_default: DEFAULT CONSTANT_BOOL
    normalized_descp:
    - If CONSTANT_BOOL, then composite D_STRUCTURE such as D_STRUCTURE and tf RaggedTensor
      are expanded into their component D_STRUCTURE
  structure:
    descp: an arbitrarily nested structure or a scalar object. Note, numpy arrays
      are considered scalars.
    normalized_descp:
    - an arbitrarily nested structure or a scalar object
    - Note, numpy D_STRUCTURE are considered scalars
exceptions:
- TypeError: The nest is or contains a dict with non-sortable keys.
