constraints:
  feature_ids:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. Rank 1 tensor with ids for each feature. This is
      the real id of the feature that will be used in the split.
  gains:
    descp: A list with the same length as node_ids of Tensor objects with type float32.
      List of rank 1 tensors representing the gains for each of the feature's split.
  learning_rate:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32. shrinkage const for each new tree.
  left_node_contribs:
    descp: A list with the same length as node_ids of Tensor objects with type float32.
      List of rank 2 tensors with left leaf contribs for each of the feature's splits.
      Will be added to the previous node values to constitute the values of the left
      nodes.
  max_depth:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. Max depth of the tree to build.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  node_ids:
    descp: A list of Tensor objects with type int32. List of rank 1 tensors representing
      the nodes for which this feature has a split.
  pruning_mode:
    descp: An int that is >= 0. 0-No pruning, 1-Pre-pruning, 2-Post-pruning.
  right_node_contribs:
    descp: A list with the same length as node_ids of Tensor objects with type float32.
      List of rank 2 tensors with right leaf contribs for each of the feature's splits.
      Will be added to the previous node values to constitute the values of the right
      nodes.
  thresholds:
    descp: A list with the same length as node_ids of Tensor objects with type int32.
      List of rank 1 tensors representing the thesholds for each of the feature's
      split.
  tree_ensemble_handle:
    descp: A Tensor of type resource. Handle to the ensemble variable.
